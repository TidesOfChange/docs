Now that you have a story to tell, it’s time to play! As you and your players navigate through the world you have created (or are exploring one that’s already made), there is some push and pull between the path you have in mind and what players want to do.
Player Choices
	Playing a game in a large open world can lead to many different ways of achieving the same goal. Video games of the modern age have taken this approach, to where you can sometimes reach the final parts of a game as soon as a tutorial is complete. TTRPGs combat this with player leveling, where it would be enormously difficult to confront “The Big Bad” at level one. Still, players may be faced with multiple paths in the (metaphorical) road to take. In this case, the GM can help by laying out the potential consequences of taking one road or the other, and how it could help the party. A GM doesn't have to be completely secretive if the party is already aware of some of the forces at play, and how it would interfere with them.
This can help standard progression through a world, but player checks and strategizing may allow wiggle room for the party to go about situations in a different way then you may imagine. In this case, specificity comes back into play, and may work for you by allowing you to determine whether that is most feasible for players to do, and how to narrate the party tackling that problem. By knowing the bounds of the world, you can know what would be crazy, and that should inform your success thresholds. This should be the default instead of just saying “No.” As mentioned, it’s good to “yes, and…”, but sometimes, what a player wants to do may seem too crazy. It can be fun to try and allow something ridiculous to happen. TTRPG GM Brennan Lee Mulligan, for example, very rarely says no when roleplaying. Instead, he may ask for a very high difficulty for an action that is clearly nigh-impossible. Because of this, on a very unlikely success, you may have a moment to remember from the session that may be hilarious; and that’s what matters at the end of the day.
On moments like this, and with other checks, narrating outcomes may then be passed to you or the player. Handing over the narrative reins can be really fun to consequential actions, whether they are a success or a failure. If a player successfully wins an NPC over to their side, the GM can narrate what the NPC says in response, while the player character communicates what they say to the NPC. It’s also fun when a GM lets a player decide how they deliver a final blow, the look of the magic that emanates from them, or how they fall flat on their face. Don’t hoard the narrative reins!
NPCs
	A GM’s responsibilities do not end at narrating enemies or the world around the players, they are very likely playing characters themselves. As previously mentioned, being specific and detailed when making NPCs can help forward a plot through character to character interaction, but it’s important to know what’s necessary and what’s not. Stats are important to ensure that if a player attempts a check, they may roll opposed to an NPC. It’s also important to establish where the NPC is relationally to the world, whether that means occupation, living situation, etc. From there, you can start to flesh out their personality, mannerisms, etc. This is mostly important for prominent NPCs, but some (like a random bartender, for instance) do not necessarily have to be thorough, or even planned at all. Preparation is key for a smooth session when dealing with NPCs, especially if they are allied with the team, and they require some more detailed work to create.
Antagonists
	Villains of the story can be essential as an opposing force against the party, and the driving feeling that encourages the party to take them down. Villains have their own motivation for why they do what they do, and as flawed as they may be, they have their reasons and personal convictions. It can help to think about the end goals they have, and what they would be willing to do to get to that point. This is important for an overarching antagonist, but also for those that decide to help said antagonist.
	It is absolutely crucial that creating a villain and how evil they are should have a line. Determine what’s most appropriate for your campaign, and what subject matter should be off limits. This should be a frank discussion with your table, to ensure that the evil they face is not overly real. If the action of your villains would cause out of character discomfort, that should be avoided.
Environmental Storytelling

	The world your party traverses is post-apocalyptic. Pollution, climate change, and a new state of the world has led to a less than friendly Earth (or other world, if you so desire). Translating this into mechanics can look like harder checks for a polluted environment. Maybe more time in the land would cause slow health drainage? Debuffs? This area of mechanics can be created by the GM, or referenced in other pre-provided campaigns. Since the world was damaged by greed, there’s room for the narrative to tie back into the villains of the story and how they want to bend the environment to their will. Technology also may change based on how the world has been harmed. There are many things to think about in terms of how climate change has affected everything in your world.
