“Homebrewing” in regards to TTRPGs is a term that refers to third-party or user generated content for a game. This can extend to creating new monsters for a game, new mechanics, classes, etc. Tides of Change provides baseline lore and rules to get started, create a campaign, and play along with. If desired, external lore and mechanics can be created. Tides of Change, as mentioned, is a game centered around climate change and worldbuilding surrounding such topics. The game works best with content that aligns itself with this. There are no bounds, but some key points to remember when thinking about content and climate change:
Climate change was exacerbated by human greed
Solutions, as of the current state of the world, have been slow
Life adapts to the new environment it finds itself in
However, life has been lost due to climate change nonetheless
	Homebrewing can also allow bending of the genre the rulebook sets itself in, if desired. If, for instance, players want to take the module into a more sci-fi route, that is not restricted. Since Tides of Change is a game about climate change, it’s recommended to approach the game with that in mind.
