A story has a beginning, and middle, and an end. The common understanding of a narrative integrated itself into what we know about stories since we were young. However, it is one thing to read something written before, and another to experience a story that is in flux. When playing a tabletop RPG, things may not go exactly the way you planned when you’re telling your story, but that’s what makes it so exciting!

## The Overarching Narrative

When creating a campaign, it’s good to think about a few things:

-   The goals and development of your player characters
-   The overarching antagonistic force
-   A general path to “victory”
    -   Solid objectives for the party to accomplish on the way
    -   Which may not be immediately obvious to the players!

Stories can take many branching paths, but these points can create a solid story in the right hands. Think about the inciting incident that sparks a conflict, the obstacles that can block player progress, and the peaks of action along the way. While it’s good to be specific with the world the players are in, keeping a plot loose can help provide wiggle room for improvised moments from players, or you. It can be good to provide options for your players to take, so they don’t feel stuck in one route and so you don’t get too thwarted in your (definitely not evil) plans.

## World Specifics

Keeping a general plot loose can lead to many possibilities, but if your world feels too loose, you may find it difficult to keep things specific, and your players can lose track of information. Think about the amount of details that go into a single interaction in your life, say, an interaction with a friend who works at a grocery store, and they’re helping you check out. So many un-thought specifics can come up, for instance:

-   How long have you been friends?
-   Are you on the best of terms?
-   How do you greet each other?
-   What’s happening in both of your lives? What do you know and don’t know at that moment?
-   What are you checking out? Why?
-   Where are you planning on going after? Where were you before?
-   What currency are you using to check out?

The list goes on. While you don’t have to know absolutely everything when roleplaying, specificity is key in both roleplaying and world creation. Having the essentials of a situation and leaving room for improvised lore that follows the world’s rules is often enough. If your players ask an NPC if they know certain information about another NPC, you should know at the very least who is in that NPC’s immediate circle. Maybe someone in that NPC’s circle knows them? However, if your players ask about the NPC’s favorite food or color, that will most likely be something you imagine at the moment.

The specifics of the world are also important. Everything we do in our daily lives is affected by forces that we don’t think much about. The world of Tides of Change, in this case, is best informed by provided lore in the rulebook. Study up! Don’t be afraid to take notes and to have it on reference. All the details shown in the rulebook and campaigns are about equal to what you would need to have in your own campaign if you decide to create your own.
