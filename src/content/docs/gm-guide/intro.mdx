Would you consider yourself to be a storyteller? Do you enjoy exploring and probing someone’s character by putting them in thrilling situations? Would your experience be fulfilled by concluding a thrilling narrative with “The End”? If so, being a Gamemaster may be appealing to you!

A Gamemaster for Tides of Change acts as the main storyteller of the campaign, a referee for the rules, and portrays all non-player characters, or NPCs. Tides of Change has multiple starter campaigns to choose from, but a GM’s responsibility can include crafting a custom campaign if desired. This role is very important - it’s difficult to run a cohesive story while you are playing it as a character as well! A Gamemaster also holds key details of a campaign that players may not know about. Thus, it may be important to keep your cards close to your chest depending on what your campaign is about. But, it’s also important to be transparent on occasion!

Here are some important qualities to a good GM:

## A good GM should “yes, and” when appropriate!
Do you remember the improv troupe from your high school or university? They made up stories, characters, and motivations on the spot! Your players are doing just that (If they (and let’s be real, you) are playing this game, there’s a much higher chance you have a background in improv anyway). That means you’ll have plenty thrown at you to process and respond to either as the GM or an NPC. It’s a GM’s job to take these and respond in character or advance the story. Remember - it’s always more fun to entertain a bad idea than to immediately shut it down! For example, you could set a higher difficulty check for an inane player action that would be either devastating if failed, or stupidly genius if succeeded. 

## A good GM should have deep knowledge of the rules!

Seriously - players may want to tackle a problem they face that may be nebulous in the rules. In this case, the GM mediates and decides how to interpret the rules. To prevent most instances of this happening, a GM should be very well-versed in the rules of Tides of Change to keep things moving and flowing. For instance, knowing which checks should be asked for during what situations can help you make quicker decisions for players. Above all else - follow the Rule of Cool™! If it sounds cool and you can make it happen, even if it isn’t strictly outlined in the rules, it’s still likely fun!

## A good GM knows their story!
You wouldn’t want to be caught without words if a player succeeds a check to remember some history of the world they’re in. Part of GM’ing requires knowledge of the world your player characters inhabit, alongside everything else that the players may not know. It helps to organize all notes beforehand to have them available to reference. You should also know the development of your players’ characters! 

## A good GM is a good actor!
You don’t have to earn an Oscar to GM, but it’s always engaging to flesh out your world through the NPCs you voice. Be theatrical! Wave your arms around, growl, scream in pain, it’s also fun! What you give, your players will reflect back to you.

## Most importantly: A good GM (and table) knows boundaries.
Consider establishing ground rules for avoiding topics your players may not want to dive into. Make sure your table knows they can stop at any time if they are uncomfortable, and do what you can to ensure that does not happen in the first place. If intergroup tension or arguments arrive, know that you can stop a session at any time to reset and ensure that everyone is comfortable.

## Session 0
Before the first session of a campaign you may have, it’s highly recommended to have a session with your players that establishes how the game is played, and what content your campaign should dive into. At a session zero, you can (and should!) do the following:
- Introduce yourselves, as needed, and what characters you will be playing
- **Content warnings, and group discussion of themes to be avoided**
- Lore dives into what baseline knowledge player characters will be aware of
- Backstories, as needed
- Some players might keep this secret
- Explanation of the rules as needed
- A short session that establishes the flow of gameplay
	- Can be an example combat scenario, puzzle, or character to NPC interaction
	- Can be the session where you also establish how the party meets!
	- With both, this can help players practice roleplaying
