Global changes – some natural, some otherwise – have resulted in myriad mutations in the human population, with new species evolving in accordance with their environments. In Tides of Change, you will play as a specific species, who stems from one of the many global cultures, and who has its own unique strengths and weaknesses.

Each species grants a +1 to a specific attribute at character creation, along with 5 skills that begin “unlocked” for the character. Note that some of these starting skills might overlap with the starting skills that your background will offer. At the GM’s discretion, there may be a possibility for swapping out starting skills if there is a lot of overlap between your species and background. Each species comes with a unique ability as well as a unique weakness. While abilities and weaknesses are balanced against each other within each species, some species may have more significant abilities/weaknesses than others.

The following are the playable species options along with brief descriptions of each. You can view the longer entries on each for more details. Species have also been organized by complexity. Some options have more mechanics or more decisions that need to be made in character creation than others, and to support novice players (as well as players who like a challenge!), beginner and advanced options have been identified for you on a 1-5 scale (one being simplest).
