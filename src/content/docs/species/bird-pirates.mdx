## The Avenari

The Avenari are a relatively new species, native only to the Aeolian Archipelago. When humans were forced to the tops of the mountains after the seas rose, they entered the domain of the birds. Nobody knows whether humans slowly started looking like birds or birds started taking on humanoid characteristics, but the result of hundreds of years of coexistence is a wide variety of bird-human hybrids - collectively called the Avenari. No two Avenar are exactly alike, with some traits more heavily pronounced than others. Some Avenari may have the head of a bird, others may only have feathers or the eyes of a bird. Most Avenari have wings and arms, but some might have fully-formed human hands while others have talons. It’s entirely possible for some Avenari to pass as a human when their wings are hidden, and it’s also possible for some Avenari to disguise themselves as large birds flying off in the distance. 

Regardless of their appearance, Avenari tend to flock together, forming tight-knit communities and lifetime bonds. Although they can be slightly territorial at times, Avenari are generally accepting and tolerant of other species, with some non-traditional Avenari even forming flocks with other species. Members of the species are seen to express specificity in skills of Bartering, Deception, Thievery, Awareness, and Foraging.

## Parrot - (Personality)

Sporting colorful plumage, Parrots are smart, proud, and attention-seekers. Parrots love nothing more than showing off their knowledge or skills, making them excellent entertainers.

- **Rainbow Wings** - You have a set of colorful wings, allowing you to fly as fast as you can walk.
- **Charming Visage** - Your feathers help you make friends in any situation. When you make a Charm or Leadership check, roll a d6 and add it to your d20 roll.

## Pigeon - (Agility)

The most common subspecies, Pigeons can be found in virtually any environment, although they prefer to flock in large settlements. Pigeons tend to be skittish and shy, taking flight when startled or threatened.

- **Quick Wings** - You have a set of nondescript but effective wings, allowing you to fly twice as fast as you can walk.
- **Hyperawareness** - Your senses are tuned to pick up the smallest changes in your environment. Whenever you make a check that uses Intuition, roll a d6 and add it to the d20 roll.
- **Sensory Overload** - Loud sounds and bright flashes affect you more strongly than others. For a short time after a loud sound or bright flash, subtract 2 from any d20 roll you make and you cannot use your Hyperawareness feature.

## Pelican - (Strength)

Often seen on docks or at sea, Pelicans are the most resilient and tough Avenari. Pelicans take pride in their work and stay grounded where others might falter.

- **Large Wings** - You have a large set of black and white wings, allowing you to fly as fast as you can walk.
- **Throat Pouch** - You have a large, expandable pouch in your throat that can store up to 30 pounds within a reasonable volume. Items stored in this way can be instantly retrieved and cannot be stolen. Your throat expands to accommodate whatever you store inside.
- **Pollution Sensitivity** - Your health is tied to your environment, making it difficult to navigate artificial hazards. Whenever you make a check using something that produces pollution, roll a d6 and subtract it from your d20 roll.

## Penguin - (Health)

The most suited for traveling the high seas, Penguins are more comfortable riding the waves than the wind. Penguin Avenari are rare and slightly eccentric, but they always make a splash wherever they turn up.

- **Streamlined Body** - Although you don’t have wings, your Penguin characteristics optimize your body for swimming. In addition to your Swimming skill, you can swim twice as fast as you can walk.
- **Blubber Buffer** - Unlike other birds, your Penguin traits help you absorb more damage. Whenever you take damage, decrease the amount taken by 1.
- **Flippers** - While flippered hands are great for swimming, they lack the dexterity of claws or human hands. Whenever you make a Vehicles, Thievery, or Shooting check, roll a d6 and subtract it from your d20 roll.

## Peacock - (Intuition)

Trend setters and pioneers, when Peacocks turn on their charm nobody can look away. Although they’re known for being flamboyant, Peacock Avenari are very perceptive and understand how to deftly navigate tricky situations.

- **Unique Plumage** - You have a set of beautiful tail feathers and short wings, allowing you to fly half as fast as you can walk.
- **Captivating Dance** - Your tail feathers can endear even the most stoic person to you. Once per day, you can spread your tail feathers as an action, forcing everyone of your choice that can see you to make a Personality check (DC 8 + your Personality modifier). On a failure, the target becomes friendly to you for the rest of the day. *Note: The target retains their free will and can still become hostile if provoked.*
- **Quick to Fade** - Your wings aren’t meant for long flight and your tail feathers are quite heavy, so you can only fly in short bursts. Whenever you fly, you must land after one minute. When you fly in combat, you must land at the end of your movement.

## Puffin - (Knowledge)

Among the most intelligent of the Avenari, Puffins tend to find themselves working with machinery and technology. While their small bodies lack force and they can be clumsy, a skilled Puffin will easily outmaneuver a stronger (but dumber) foe.

- **Versatile Wings** - You have a small set of black and white wings, allowing you to fly half as fast as you can walk. Your wings also work well in water, letting you swim half as fast as you can walk in addition to your Swimming skill.
- **Seaside Technician** - Your Puffin brain lets you easily recognize and tinker with technology. Whenever you make a Vehicles, Cybernetics, or Mechanics check, roll a d6 and add it to your d20 roll.
- **Petite Puff** - Your small frame and hollow bones make physical feats of strength difficult. Whenever you make a Force or Reaction check, subtract 2 from the roll.
