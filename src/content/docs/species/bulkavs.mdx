title: Bulkavs
description: Bulkavs Species
---

Bulkavs are descendants of humans (humanoids) from a nuclear power plant who decided to try and live on the island and rebuild above ground. Consequently, they became exposed to the radiation at the surface and mutated to become a new species known as the Bulkavs. Essentially, they are enhanced humans, with characteristics such as increased size, strength, and glow in the dark skin that makes them nocturnal creatures, only functional at night. Their size ranges from 7-9 feet, and they have 4 limbs like their ancestors. Their skin during the day time has yellow hues, but at night their glow in the dark powers shine though and their bodies illuminate with a soft yellow light, similar to a firefly. Their eye colors can vary between green, brown, and hazel. For their hair, it is traditionally grown out, worn long by the males and females and sometimes can be seen worn in braids. They also come with an additional point in Strength.

## Special Abilities
Bulkavs are known for their vibrant personalities and are charming characters who make strong leaders. Their physical strength is also remarkable in lifting, pushing, and carrying objects, as well as hand-to-hand and melee combat. They also are well aware of their surroundings and are able to deduce information to figure things out. Additionally, Bulkavs have night vision, which turns off their glowing skin and makes them undetectable at night.
