## Description
Humans found it necessary to move down into the ocean and create an energy powered ecotopia called Atlantis. They were unable to live on land because of their own pollution. They power Atlantis by taking resources from Lumea as they continuously advance their technology. They value efficiency and personal gain as their priority, and therefore Atlantis  functions as a capitalistic community. Oneâ€™s wealth and economic class defines the values of the person, which affects how they are treated by the rest of the society. One can reach higher economic classes in Atlantis through pursuing education, but there is still an inequality between those who have started in a family that has higher reputation or wealth. 

The scientists act as a government of this city, where they mainly seek for the longevity of their lives and to find the efficient way to build and power Atlantis. However, this efficient way may not be the most ethical or beneficial to the environment.  Furthermore, in order to keep up with the physical prowess of the Aqualumeans, they developed technology that infuses Lux into its systems, but because Lux is not originally made for human technology, it creates magic pollution as a consequence. Because of their reliance on technology, their stats decrease without technology.

All in all, humans may be extremely intelligent and creative in the ways that they improve their technology, but their self-centeredness and selfishness hinders their successes and affects their treatment of themselves and their own species.
