## Ecotopians

The Ecotopians are a species of humans who defected from the AI-controlled dystopia, combining their biology with plants through symbiosis with nature. Separated into different ‘subspecies,’ each group has unique traits and personalities based on the plants they identify with most closely.

## Subspecies

### Arborian

#### **Description**  
A group of living life forms that resemble trees, with their bodies made of wood, branches, and leaves. They are incredibly strong and durable, making up much of the workforce within the Ecotopia. While they naturally make excellent workers, they can also become threatening fighters. The Arborian leader is **Trunkules**.

#### **Biology**  
- Living, talking, and moving trees with branches operating as arms, leaves as hair, and roots used for movement.  
- Slow-moving but incredibly strong and durable.  
- Leaves change color and amount based on the time of year. In winter, they enter a ‘hibernation’ mode, moving more slowly and staying within their forest biome to avoid being stuck in dangerous areas.

#### **Culture**  
- Value **age, physical strength, and hard work**.  
- Respect their elders and answer to the "great tree," though younger trees may rebel temporarily.  
- Family, connection, and community are central values. Arborians are extremely loyal to party members but prioritize their own subspecies above others.  

#### **Society**  
- Organized as a **military dictatorship** under the leadership of Trunkules, the "great tree."  
- Age determines social hierarchy, with older trees holding higher status.  
- Traditionally open to Mycelians and Florians but have become more reserved due to past disagreements.  

#### **Attributes and Skills**  
- **Free Attribute Point:** Strength, +1  
- **Bonus Skills:** Force, Fear, Foraging, Mechanics, Awareness  

#### **Unique Abilities and Weaknesses**  
- **Unique Ability:** Rooted  
  - Can root themselves to the ground during combat, greatly increasing melee damage but significantly restricting movement temporarily.  
- **Unique Weakness:** Flammable  
  - Vulnerable to fire attacks, taking extra damage in fire-related environments.

### Mycelian

#### **Description**  
A species of living mushroom people, small and delicate but exceptionally skilled in magic. They communicate telepathically across great distances with other fungi and navigate vast underground tunnel networks. Highly adept at stealth and illusion magic.

#### **Biology**  
- Small, delicate humanoid mushroom-like creatures with mushroom caps for hair.  
- Different mushrooms grow on their bodies, reflecting the cave system of their origin.  
- Telepathy and magic are strongest in their cave environments.  

#### **Culture**  
- Extremely **closed-off**, wary of outsiders and other species.  
- Strongly value collectivism, rejecting individualism in favor of telepathic connection with their cave community.  
- Different cave systems have distinct beliefs, making unification under a single government impossible.  

#### **Society**  
- No centralized leadership; all Mycelians value their home-cave above others.  
- Lack of stratification, with decisions often made collectively or based on cave allegiance.  

#### **Attributes and Skills**  
- **Free Attribute Point:** Magic, +1  
- **Bonus Skills:** Foraging, Thievery, Sneakiness, Tracking, Insight  

#### **Unique Abilities and Weaknesses**  
- **Unique Ability:** Tunneling

#### **Description**  
Living flowers that are delicate and dislike combat but excel in leadership. Their natural charisma, beauty, and scent make them exceptional political and tactical leaders. Florians often form the elite and ruling class within Ecotopia.  

#### **Biology**  
- Resemble humans with a ring of petals around their necks.  
- Petal colors and shapes vary, with red hues and larger petals considered the most beautiful.  
- Variations in appearance stem from their mimicry of flowers for survival after escaping the dystopia.  

#### **Culture**  
- Obsessed with **beauty and status**, creating a society driven by appearances.  
- Social mobility often involves struggles for power and recognition.  

#### **Society**  
- Governed by an **oligarchical structure** that values aesthetics and societal rank.  
- Led by the most powerful figure, **Dan D. Lion**, who embodies their cultural ideals.  

#### **Attributes and Skills**  
- **Free Attribute Point:** Personality, +1  
- **Bonus Skills:** Foraging, Leadership, Charm, Medicine, Deception  

#### **Unique Abilities and Weaknesses**  
- **Unique Ability:** Aroma  
  - Releases a sweet scent that charms anyone nearby.  
- **Unique Weakness:** Dainty  
  - Disdain for physicality and combat leads to debuffs in these areas until convinced otherwise.
