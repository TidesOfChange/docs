The Ecotopians are a species of humans who defected from the AI-controlled dystopia, combining their biology with plants through symbiosis with nature. Separated into different ‘subspecies,’ each group has unique traits and personalities based on the plants they identify with most closely.

## Subspecies

### Arborian

#### **Description**  
A group of living life forms that resemble trees, with their bodies made of wood, branches, and leaves. They are incredibly strong and durable, making up much of the workforce within the Ecotopia. While they naturally make excellent workers, they can also become threatening fighters. The Arborian leader is **Trunkules**.

#### **Biology**  
Living, talking, and moving trees: their large branches operate as arms, leaves are the equivalent to hair, and move around with their roots that snake across the ground. Very slow but hard to keep them from moving, and incredibly strong. The color of leaves change based on the time of year, and the amount also increases/decreases throughout the year. During the times of year where they have less leaves, i.e. winter, the trees move much more slowly and are essentially in ‘hibernation’ mode. As such, they typically stay within their own forest biome as they run into a risk of being stuck in dangerous territory if winter hits.

#### **Culture**  
Value age, physical strength, and hard-work. They are brought up to respect their elders and to answer to the ‘great tree’ without question, but some might ‘rebel’ in their younger years. However, because of the importance of family, connection, and community within their society, they always come back and put the other trees over anything else. Within the game, Arborian players may be extremely loyal to their party members, but ultimately will always respect their own subspecies more.

#### **Society**  
Live within a ‘military dictatorship’ tribe: look up to a single ‘great’ tree, Trunkules, that has lived for generations. Extremely work-centered and, if needed, militaristic society. Age is valued; the older a tree is, the higher status in society they have. The trees are traditionally more open to the Mycelians and Florians, but due to disagreements in the past, have been forced to become more reserved and independent. 

#### **Attributes and Skills**  
- **Free Attribute Point:** Strength, +1  
- **Bonus Skills:** Force, Fear, Foraging, Mechanics, Awareness  

#### **Unique Abilities and Weaknesses**  
- **Unique Ability:** Rooted  
  - Can root themselves to the ground during combat to increase their melee damage by 1 harm, but significantly restricts their movement for a temporary time.
- **Unique Weakness:** Flammable  
  - Particularly weak to fire/flame attacks and environments, take extra harm from fire related attacks.

### Mycelian

#### **Description**  
A species of living mushroom people, small and delicate but extremely effective with certain schools of magic. They can communicate over great distances with other fungi using telepathy (have the opportunity to do so with other species, but this requires a great amount of energy and often leaves them immobilized for a time), and have a vast network of tunnels underground that only they have access to. Apt for stealth.

#### **Biology**  
Extremely small and delicate mushroom people. Resemble humans but have a mushroom cap for hair, and many have different species of mushrooms growing on their arms, legs, and torsos that represent what cave system they were born and raised in. Their telepathy and illusion magic becomes strongest when within these caves, and as such, they prefer staying within their cave systems and steer clear of the surface as much as possible.

#### **Culture**  
Extremely closed off - do not necessarily see their culture as the ‘best,’ but are EXTREMELY wary of others and their differences. Individualism is highly rejected within their culture, as their telepathy and connectedness with all Mycelians from their caves brings them all together. Certain caves, however, have created different cultural/societal beliefs, making a greater government virtually impossible for the Mycelians. They are incredibly closed off to the Florians and Arborians, one of the key reasons why the three groups have not fully united against the Dystopia.

#### **Society**  
The Mycelians, because of their lack of individualism, have no clear social stratification; there is no singular Mycelian that has control over them all. However, Mycelians tend to value their own home-cave over others, and might get into conflicts with the others as they value their own home-cave over anything else.

#### **Attributes and Skills**  
- **Free Attribute Point:** Intuition, +1  
- **Bonus Skills:** Foraging, Thievery, Sneakiness, Tracking, Insight  

#### **Unique Abilities and Weaknesses**  
- **Unique Ability:** Tunneling  
  - Can tunnel underground and travel distances while remaining unseen - can be used within combat or any stealth related scenario.
- **Unique Weakness:** Squishy  
  - Particularly weak to any sort of physical damage (bullets/arrows, melee) resulting in a -1 harm threshold.

### Florian

![Illustration of flower person](../../../assets/sylvangrove/flower-person.png)

#### **Description**  
Living flowers that are extremely delicate and hate combat, but make extremely good leaders. Their naturally high charisma, owing to their good scent and beautiful looks, make them extremely apt for political and tactical leadership. Typically make up the ‘elites’ and politicians within the Ecotopia. 

#### **Biology**  
Florians each have a beautiful ring of petals that surround their necks. These petals come in many different shapes and colors, but in general colors that are closer to red and bigger petals are seen as more beautiful. This high variance in Florian biology is due to the various flowers in the Ecotopia that they have mimicked in order for survival when they originally escaped the dystopian society.

#### **Culture**  
Florians mainly value looks and status due to their obsession with beauty stemming from their flowery origins. There are often struggles for power and status as Florians try to move up in society. 

#### **Society**  
The Florians have organized themselves into an oligarchical government structure. This is due to how it is Florian nature to put heavy weight on looks and status of societal members. The leader of Florian society and their most powerful figure is a Florian named Dan Dee Lion.

#### **Attributes and Skills**  
- **Free Attribute Point:** Personality, +1  
- **Bonus Skills:** Foraging, Leadership, Charm, Medicine, Deception  

#### **Unique Abilities and Weaknesses**  
- **Unique Ability:** Aroma  
  - Can release a sweet flowery scent that temporarily charms anyone around them. 
- **Unique Weakness:** Dainty  
  - Due to their disdain for physicality and combat, they have -2 modifier to these skills until they are convinced otherwise.
