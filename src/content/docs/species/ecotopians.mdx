Ecotopians are the Sylvangrove species that defected away from the AI-controlled dystopia - a group of humans whose biology have been effectively combined with plants as a result of their symbiosis with nature. Separated by different ‘subspecies,’ each group has their own traits and personalities based on the plants they identify closest with.

## Arborian

A group of living life forms that resemble trees, with their bodies made of wood, branches, and leaves. They are incredibly strong and durable, making up much of the workforce within the Ecotopia. While they naturally make excellent workers, they can also become threatening fighters. The Arborian leader is **Trunkules**.

### Special Attributes
Arborians can root themselves to the ground during combat to increase their melee damage by 1 harm, but their movement is significantly restricted for a temporary period of time. They are also an incredibly strong species whose anatomy is that of a tree. Due to their form, they also have an additional attribute point from strength. 

### Skills for Character Creation
- Force
- Fear	
- Foraging
- Mechanics
- Awareness

### Special Weaknesses
Despite their strength, Arborians are highly flammable. They are very weak against fire/flame attacks and environments and take extra damage from fire related attacks. 

### Social Hierarchy
Arborians live within a ‘military dictatorship’ tribe, looking up to a single ‘great’ tree, Trunkules, who has lived for generations. Society is extremely work-centered and, if needed, militaristic. The status of a tree is directly tied to its age, with the oldest trees garnering the most respect. They are traditionally more open to the Mycelians and Florians, but due to disagreements in the past, have been forced to become more reserved and independent. Arborians value age, physical strength, and hard-work, and are brought up to respect their elders. They answer to the ‘great tree’ without question, but some might ‘rebel’ in their younger years. However, because of the importance of family, connection, and community within their society, they always come back and put the other trees over anything else. Within the game, Arborian players may be extremely loyal to their party members, but ultimately will always respect their own subspecies more.

## Mycelian

Mycelians are a species of living mushroom people, small and delicate but extremely effective with certain schools of magic. They can communicate over great distances with other fungi using telepathy (have the opportunity to do so with other species, but this requires a great amount of energy and often leaves them immobilized for a time), and have a vast network of tunnels underground that only they have access to. The species is apt for stealth. They resemble humans but have a mushroom cap for hair, and many have different species of mushrooms growing on their arms, legs, and torsos that represent what cave system they were born and raised in.

### Special Abilities
Their telepathy and illusion magic becomes strongest when within these caves, and as such, they prefer staying within their cave systems and steer clear of the surface as much as possible. They can tunnel underground and travel distances unseen within combat or any stealth related scenario. An attribute point is added for intuition. 

### Skills for Character Creation 
- Foraging
- Thievery
- Sneakiness
- Tracking
- Insight

### Special Weaknesses
Mycelians are squishy creatures that are particularly vulnerable to any physical damage (bullets, arrows, melee) resulting in a -1 harm threshold. 

### Social Hierarchy
Extremely closed off - do not necessarily see their culture as the ‘best,’ but are EXTREMELY wary of others and their differences. Individualism is highly rejected within their culture, as their telepathy and connectedness with all Mycelians from their caves brings them all together. Certain caves, however, have created different cultural/societal beliefs, making a greater government virtually impossible for the Mycelians. They are incredibly closed off to the Florians and Arborians, one of the key reasons why the three groups have not fully united against the Dystopia. The Mycelians, because of their lack of individualism, have no clear social stratification; there is no singular Mycelian that has control over them all. However, Mycelians tend to value their own home-cave over others, and might get into conflicts with the others as they value their own home-cave over anything else.

## Florian

Florians are living flowers that are extremely delicate and hate combat, but make extremely good leaders. Their naturally high charisma, owing to their good scent and beautiful looks, make them extremely apt for political and tactical leadership. They typically make up the ‘elites’ and politicians within the Ecotopia. Florians each have a beautiful ring of petals that surround their necks. These petals come in many different shapes and colors, but in general colors that are closer to red and bigger petals are seen as more beautiful. This high variance in Florian biology is due to the various flowers in the Ecotopia that they have mimicked in order for survival when they originally escaped the dystopian society.

### Special Abilities 
Florians gain an extra point for Personality. They can release a sweet flowery aroma that temporarily charms everyone around them. 

### Skills for Character Creation
- Foraging
- Leadership
- Charm
- Medicine
- Deception

### Special Weaknesses 
Florians’ strong disdain for physicality and combat gives them a -2 modifier to physicality and combat unless otherwise persuaded. 

### Social Hierarchy 
The Florians have organized themselves into an oligarchical government structure. This is due to how it is Florian nature to put heavy weight on looks and status of societal members. The leader of Florian society and their most powerful figure is a Florian named Dan Dee Lion. Florians mainly value looks and status due to their obsession with beauty stemming from their flowery origins. There are often struggles for power and status as Florians try to move up in society.
