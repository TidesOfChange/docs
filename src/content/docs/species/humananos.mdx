## Description

In the bubbled ruins of Karkorte, the Humananos are treated as outcasts, forced to exist on the outermost edges of the city‚Äîthe most dangerous and unprotected regions where monsters breach the bubble most often. To the Kraken and Moby, they are little more than expendable fodder, placed there in the grim hope that their suffering will keep the monsters at bay.

And when sacrifices are demanded, the Humananos are the first to be chosen, their lives offered without hesitation to appease the city's cruel traditions. They are not protected. They are not mourned. They are merely the forsaken, surviving each day on borrowed time.

But not all are content to accept their fate.

A group of brave Humananos, filled by curiosity and a deep, unyielding hope, have chosen to escape the harsh confines of Karkorte. These survivors, united by a shared desire for freedom and the search for a better life, have set their sights on the mythical forest of Ashenvale, whispered about in ancestral tales.

They are no longer willing to be sacrificed, no longer willing to hide. Driven by a fierce determination to find new purpose and new hope, they venture out into the unknown.

The forest of Ashenvale may hold the key to the salvation of their kind, or it may be a false promise. Whatever awaits them on the other side, they know that it is a chance worth taking.

## Core Skills and Abilities

### Adaptive Resilience (Unique Ability)
Years of hiding and surviving have hardened the Humananos for this moment. Whether through instinct or sheer will, they can **force their bodies to adapt**, sprouting new features to meet the party‚Äôs needs. As they endure hardships‚Äîwhether through combat, survival, or sheer perseverance‚Äîtheir mutations become more **specialized**, allowing them to **evolve into distinct roles** as their journey progresses. Players can work with the GM to determine appropriate mutations and the bonuses they grant, as well as the disadvantages endured. 

### Iron Stomach (Extra Attribute: +1 to Health)
Years of scavenging have toughened their bodies, granting them a **natural resistance** to **sickness** and **foodborne toxins**. They can **stomach meals** that would make others violently ill‚Äîor worse.

### Starting Skills (two additional granted by faction below)

#### Foraging Expertise (Foraging)
A lifetime of surviving on scraps has made the Humananos **exceptional scavengers**. They can **identify edible plants, salvageable materials, and hidden resources** in even the most desolate environments.

#### Hidden in Plain Sight (Sneakiness)
In a society where attention spells danger, Humananos have honed the art of **stealth**. Born from years of surviving on the fringes of Karkorte, they **move like elusive shadows**. Whether dodging the scrutiny of oppressive elites or evading lurking predators, their innate ability to **remain undetected** is both a vital survival instinct and a quiet act of defiance.

#### Outcast‚Äôs Vigilance (Awareness)
Living in a dangerous area has honed the senses of the Humananos to near-perfection. Constant exposure to the perils of Karkorte has made them **hyper-aware, attuned** to even the **slightest disturbances** in their surroundings. Their vigilance allows them to **detect hidden threats and subtle clues**, ensuring that nothing goes unnoticed in the unforgiving wasteland.

## Subspecies Faction

In addition to the above, select one of the two factions for your Humanano to further customize them.

### The Wasteland Reclaimers
*"We don‚Äôt take this land. We defend it. Ashenvale has suffered enough."*

#### Background Purpose & Function in Society

The Wasteland Reclaimers see Ashenvale as a sanctuary, not a battleground. Instead of seeking to conquer the land, they have chosen to stand with the Apomonosis, defending their sacred territory from invaders.

Some Reclaimers were former Karkorte enforcers who abandoned their old ways. Others are survivors who see the Apomonosis as the last hope for restoring balance. They have trained in tribal warfare, survival techniques, and the ancient traditions of Ashenvale, proving their loyalty through blood and battle.

**Extra Skills:** Through their skill in negotiation and their willingness to seek alliances, the Wasteland Reclaimers have earned a reputation as diplomats in a hostile world. Their ability to navigate tense situations and forge bonds with the enigmatic Apomonosis unlocks Leadership and Charm as additional skills

**Weakness - Not All Is Fair in War:** The Wasteland Reclaimers, due to their diplomatic nature, prefer a fair fight (if needed in the first place). They will not engage in surprise attacks.

#### Optional Expertise Tree Customization
*Unique to this species, after selecting the background, players have the option of replacing the first column of that background‚Äôs expertise tree with one of the two options below. Leveling these expertises follows the normal rules.*

##### Specialty: Paragon of Solace, The Guiding Light ‚ú®
- Level 1 ability: Healing Touch
  - Once per day can channel radiant energy to the palms, automatically healing 2 harm from a single ally touched.
- Level 2 ability: Blessing of Renewal
  - Once per day can radiate a soothing aura that steadily restores 2 harm to up to 4 nearby allies. The effect intensifies when allies are below half health, increasing the healing to 3.
- Level 3 ability: Divine Rejuvenation
  - Once per day unleashes a surge of celestial energy, fully restoring all allies in range and possessing the power to revive a single fallen ally.

##### Specialty: Tidecaller, The Wavebound Mystic üåä
- Level 1 ability: Grasp of the Tides
  - Condenses moisture from the air and surroundings, forming tendrils of water that constrict and slow an enemy‚Äôs movements for a short duration.
- Level 2 ability: Frozen Depths
  - Temporarily freezes an enemy with a layer of ice, reducing their movement speed. Additionally, roll a d6 and on a 5 or 6 the enemy is completely frozen in place.

### The OutKast SeeKeers
*‚ÄúThis land is not yours. The Apomonosis will not share it. If you do not leave, they will make you‚Äù*

#### Background Purpose & Function in Society

The OutKast SeeKeers are those who have been exiled from Karkorte or came to Ashenvale seeking their own claim, only to be met with hostility. The Apomonosis see them as invaders, hunting them down without mercy. To survive, Outcast Seekers have become ruthless survivalists, mercenaries, or warlords, determined to carve out a piece of the wasteland for themselves‚Äîby force if necessary.

Some were once scavengers searching for lost technology. Others were fighters who refused to bend the knee to Apomonosis rule. Now, they are locked in a brutal war, forced to fight against warriors who have survived the wasteland for generations.

**Extra Skills:** From the moment they first clashed with the Apomonosis, the OutKast SeeKeers have embraced war as their only path forward. Their bodies are hardened by relentless combat, their strength sharpened by bloodshed. Having proven their dominance through sheer aggression unlocks Force and Fear as additional skills

**Weakness, Hotheaded:** Strike first, ask questions later. The SeeKeers prefer stabs and slashes over words and negotiations. They receive a -1 penalty in Charm and Barter.

#### Optional Expertise Tree Customization
*Unique to this species, after selecting the background, players have the option of replacing the first column of that background‚Äôs expertise tree with one of the two options below. Leveling these expertises follows the normal rules.*

##### Specialty: Raging Fury, The Battle-Fueled Warrior üí¢
- Level 1 ability: Fuel of Rage
  - Once per combat can enter a state of rage, increasing damage dealt by 1 harm per attack for a brief duration.

  - Strikes an enemy with a powerful attack that forces them to focus their aggression solely on you.
- Level 2 ability: Taunting Challenge
  - Issues a challenge to all nearby enemies, forcing them to attack only you for a short time. In doing so, enemies become distracted, reducing the DC to hit them by -2 for all other players. Also imposes a -2 to enemies‚Äô reaction checks.
- Level 3 ability: Instigator's Euphoria
  - When enemies relentlessly target the Germanium, their attacks become a source of twisted delight. Each blow not only fails to bring you down, but instead fuels your vigor. Three times during a combat encounter, one hit absorbed from a taunted foe heals you 1 harm and amplifies damage output by 1 harm on your next attack, as you revel in the chaos you have orchestrated.
