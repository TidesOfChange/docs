---

In the bubbled ruins of Karkorte, the Humananos are treated as outcasts, forced to exist on the outermost edges of the city—the most dangerous and unprotected regions where monsters breach the bubble most often. To the Kraken and Moby, they are little more than expendable fodder, placed there in the grim hope that their suffering will keep the monsters at bay. And when sacrifices are demanded, the Humananos are the first to be chosen, their lives offered without hesitation to appease the city's cruel traditions. They are neither protected nor mourned. They are merely the forsaken, surviving each day on borrowed time. But not all are content to accept their fate. A group of brave Humananos, filled by curiosity and a deep, unyielding hope, have chosen to escape the harsh confines of Karkorte. These survivors, united by a shared desire for freedom and the search for a better life, have set their sights on the mythical forest of Ashenvale, whispered about in ancestral tales. They are no longer willing to be sacrificed, no longer willing to hide. Driven by a fierce determination to find new purpose and new hope, they venture out into the unknown. The forest of Ashenvale may hold the key to the salvation of their kind, or it may be a false promise. Whatever awaits them on the other side, they know that it is a chance worth taking.

## Special Abilities

Years of hiding and surviving have hardened the Humananos for this moment. Whether through instinct or sheer will, they can force their bodies to adapt, sprouting new features to meet the party’s needs. As they endure hardships—whether through combat, survival, or sheer perseverance—their mutations become more specialized, allowing them to evolve into distinct roles as their journey progresses. Players can work with the GM to determine appropriate mutations and the bonuses they grant, as well as the disadvantages endured. Additionally, years of scavenging have toughened their bodies, granting them a natural resistance to sickness and foodborne toxins. They can stomach meals that would make others violently ill—or worse. Their iron stomach attributes an additional point to health. A lifetime of surviving on scraps has made the Humananos exceptional scavengers. They can identify edible plants, salvageable materials, and hidden resources in even the most desolate environments. In a society where attention spells danger, Humananos have honed the art of stealth. Born from years of surviving on the fringes of Karkorte, they move like elusive shadows. Whether dodging the scrutiny of oppressive elites or evading lurking predators, their innate ability to remain undetected is both a vital survival instinct and a quiet act of defiance. Living in a dangerous area has honed the senses of the Humananos to near-perfection. Constant exposure to the perils of Karkorte has made them hyper-aware, attuned to even the slightest disturbances in their surroundings. Their vigilance allows them to detect hidden threats and subtle clues, ensuring that nothing goes unnoticed in the unforgiving wasteland.

## The Wasteland Reclaimers

> _"We don’t take this land. We defend it. Ashenvale has suffered enough."_

The Wasteland Reclaimers see Ashenvale as a sanctuary, not a battleground. Instead of seeking to conquer the land, they have chosen to stand with the Apomonosis, defending their sacred territory from invaders. Some Reclaimers were former Karkorte enforcers who abandoned their old ways. Others are survivors who see Apomonosis as the last hope for restoring balance. They have trained in tribal warfare, survival techniques, and the ancient traditions of Ashenvale, proving their loyalty through blood and battle.

### Special Abilities

Through their skill in negotiation and their willingness to seek alliances, the Wasteland Reclaimers have earned a reputation as diplomats in a hostile world. Their ability to navigate tense situations and forge bonds with the enigmatic Apomonosis unlocks Leadership and Charm as additional skills

### Special Weaknesses

The Wasteland Reclaimers, due to their diplomatic nature, prefer a fair fight (if needed in the first place). They will not engage in surprise attacks.

## The OutKast SeeKeers

> _“This land is not yours. The Apomonosis will not share it. If you do not leave, they will make you.”_

The OutKast SeeKeers are those who have been exiled from Karkorte or came to Ashenvale seeking their own claim, only to be met with hostility. The Apomonosis see them as invaders, hunting them down without mercy. To survive, Outcast Seekers have become ruthless survivalists, mercenaries, or warlords, determined to carve out a piece of the wasteland for themselves—by force if necessary. Some were once scavengers searching for lost technology. Others were fighters who refused to bend the knee to Apomonosis rule. Now, they are locked in a brutal war, forced to fight against warriors who have survived the wasteland for generations.

### Special Abilities

From the moment they first clashed with the Apomonosis, the OutKast SeeKeers have embraced war as their only path forward. Their bodies are hardened by relentless combat, their strength sharpened by bloodshed. Having proven their dominance through sheer aggression unlocks Force and Fear as additional skills.

### Special Weaknesses

OutKast SeeKeers are hot headed, known to strike first and ask questions later. The SeeKeers prefer stabs and slashes over words and negotiations. They receive a -1 penalty in Charm and Barter.

| **Tier&nbsp;1** | **Fuel of Rage:** Once per combat can enter a state of rage, increasing damage dealt by 1 harm per attack for a brief duration.                                                                                                                                                  | **Provocative Strike:** Strikes an enemy with a powerful attack that forces them to focus their aggression solely on you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Tier&nbsp;2** | **Bloodthirst:** Once per combat, with every wound suffered, the thirst for destruction grows. Each time damage is taken, attacks become +1 stronger, maxing out at +5.                                                                                                          | **Taunting Challenge:** Issues a challenge to all nearby enemies, forcing them to attack only you for a short time. In doing so, enemies become distracted, reducing the DC to hit them by -2 for all other players. Also imposes a -2 to enemies’ reaction checks.                                                                                                                                            |
| **Tier&nbsp;3** | **Incarnate of Destruction:** Unleashes the full force of rage in a 20-foot radius, dealing massive area damage. Targets roll Agility or Strength (their choice). On a 14 or below, they take 4 harm. On a 15 and up they take 2 harm. Structures are also damaged or destroyed. | **Instigator’s Euphoria:** When enemies relentlessly target the Germanium, their attacks become a source of twisted delight. Each blow not only fails to bring you down, but instead fuels your vigor. Three times during a combat encounter, one hit absorbed from a taunted foe heals you 1 harm and amplifies damage output by 1 harm on your next attack, as you revel in the chaos you have orchestrated. |
