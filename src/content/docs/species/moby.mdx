Mobys were former humans a long time ago from when the world first started going underwater. The effect of the power plant explosion has caused the area around the city to become radiated. The prolonged exposure of the radiation has caused humans to develop sonar abilities.

## Special Abilities
They exhibit an eye-like appendage that functions like a sonar detector. With sonar, they are able to accurately map out areas of 200 feet outwards from them. Their sonar increases awareness by 1 point, and they have an additional attribute point from intuition.

## Skills for Character Creation
- Awareness
- Swimming
- Leadership
- Sneakiness
- Deduction

## Special Weaknesses
However, a huge disadvantage is their weakness to loud noises. Loud noises would cause their senses to overload and harm them in the process. Overstimulation from environmental influx disables them for a round. 

## Social Hierarchy
In Karkorte, Mobys play the role of logistics and planning. They are usually the brains that work on each expedition. They function to govern Karkorte, plan navigations and explorations, and maximize resources. Mobys are vital towards the city as they are the leaders which prevent Karkorte from falling. Socally, they are loners. They usually tend to not group around together as much as the Krakens do. Rather, they put their pride in their ability to map out their surroundings well. The more detailed that they can get through their sonar abilities, the more that they are praised among their community.
