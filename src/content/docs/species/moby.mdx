## Description

Mobys were former humans a long time ago from when the world first started going underwater. The effect of the power plant explosion has caused the area around the city to become radiated. The prolonged exposure of the radiation has caused humans to develop sonar abilities. Physically the humans have changed to exhibit an eye-like appendage that functions like a sonar detector. This species may have slightly different appearances, but they all inhabit the eye like appendages. With sonar they are able to accurately map out areas of around 200 feet outwards from them. However a huge disadvantage is their weakness to loud noises. Loud noises would cause their senses to overload and harm them in the process.

Societally they are a little bit of loners. They usually tend to not group around together as much as the Krakens do. They however put their pride in their ability to map out their surroundings well. The more detailed that they can get through their sonar abilities, the more that they are praised among their community.

In Karkorte they play the role of logistics and planning. They are usually the brains that work on each expedition. They function to make sure that everybody remains safe and to maximize the resources that they can gather. Mobys are vital towards the city as they are the leaders which prevent Karkorte from falling.
