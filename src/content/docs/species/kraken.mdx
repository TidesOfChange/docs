description: Kraken Species
---

Krakens were former humans, long before the world started submerging. The effect of the power plant explosion has caused the area around the city to become radiated. The prolonged exposure to the radiation has caused the humans to grow extra limbs from their bodies, however the increase in limbs have impaired their cognitive abilities due to more brain power needed to control each limb, leading to them being less intelligent than humans in general. Their body structure is very diverse; they can range from having extra arms to having multiple legs.

## Special Abilities
Due to their decreased intelligence, these species have put most of their values within physical abilities. Within Karkorte, Krakens do most of the physical work around the city, and they have an additional attribute point in strength. Their additional limbs add harm to all melee attacks.

## Skills for Character Creation
- Force
- Swimming
- Climbing

- Reaction

## Special Weaknesses
Krakens aren’t really that good at logistics or politics, but they know how to carry heavy loads of materials. Their most notable weakness is lower intellectual ability, mainly due to having additional limbs. Their weaker intellect contributes -1 to Knowledge. 

## Social Hierarchy
Most of the social structure consists of relying on the strongest in order to survive. With most of the structure relying upon strength, weakness is frowned upon, but the weak are not heavily discriminated against. What really is unacceptable within the species is not working hard–everybody needs to be able to pull their own weight to survive. The true hard workers of Karkorte rebuild the city time and time again. They are heavily praised around the city for their tenacity and positive attitude.
