## Description

Krakens were former humans a long time ago from when the world started going underwater. The effect of the power plant explosion has caused the area around the city to become radiated. The prolonged exposure to the radiation has caused the humans to grow extra limbs from their bodies. However the increase in limbs have impaired their cognitive abilities due to more brain power needed to control each limb, leading to them being less intelligent than humans in general. They are diverse in the sense that they are just classified as having multiple limbs, meaning that they can range from having extra arms to having multiple legs.

Due to their decreased intelligence, these species have put most of their values within physical abilities. Most of the social structure consists of relying on the strongest in order to survive. With most of the structure relying upon strength, weakness is frowned upon, but the weak are not heavily discriminated against. What really is unacceptable within the species is not working hard–everybody needs to be able to pull their weight in order to survive.

Within Karkorte, Krakens do most of the physical work around the city. They aren’t really that good at logistics or politics, but they know how to carry heavy loads of materials. The true hard workers of Karkorte, they rebuild the city over and over again. They are heavily praised around the city for their tenacity and their positive attitude.
