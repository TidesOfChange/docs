# Kraken

Krakens were former humans a long time ago from when the world started going underwater. The effect of the power plant explosion has caused the area around the city to become radiated. The prolonged exposure to the radiation has caused the humans to grow extra limbs from their bodies. However the increase in limbs have impaired their cognitive abilities due to more brain power needed to control each limb, leading to them being less intelligent than humans in general. They are diverse in the sense that they are just classified as having multiple limbs, meaning that they can range from having extra arms to having multiple legs.

Due to their decreased intelligence, these species have put most of their values within physical abilities. So the species really values athletic feats. Most of the social structure consists of relying on the strongest in order to survive. With most of the structure relying upon strength, weakness is frowned upon, but that doesn’t mean that the weak is heavily discriminated against. Since the times are really tough, what really is unacceptable within the species is not working hard. Everybody needs to be able to pull their weight in order to survive.

Within Karkorte, Krakens do most of the physical work around the city. They aren’t really that good at logistics or politics, but they know how to carry heavy loads of materials. The true hard workers of Karkorte, they rebuild the city over and over again. They are heavily praised around the city for their tenacity and their positive attitude.

## Moby

Mobys were former humans a long time ago from when the world first started going underwater. The effect of the power plant explosion has caused the area around the city to become radiated. The prolonged exposure of the radiation has caused humans to develop sonar abilities. Physically the humans have changed to exhibit an eye-like appendage that functions like a sonar detector. This species may have slightly different appearances, but they all inhabit the eye like appendages. With sonar they are able to accurately map out areas of around 200 feet outwards from them. However a huge disadvantage is their weakness to loud noises. Loud noises would cause their senses to overload and harm them in the process.

Societally they are a little bit of loners. They usually tend to not group around together as much as the Krakens do. They however put their pride in their ability to map out their surroundings well. The more detailed that they can get through their sonar abilities, the more that they are praised among their community.

In Karkorte they play the role of logistics and planning. They are usually the brains that work on each expedition. They function to make sure that everybody remains safe and to maximize the resources that they can gather. Mobys are vital towards the city as they are the leaders which prevent Karkorte from falling.
