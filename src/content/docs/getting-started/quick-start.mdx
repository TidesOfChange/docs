The very first step you will take to play Tides of Change is character creation. Provided here is a quick start guide to jump right into the action as fast as possible! Before you start at step 1, take a moment to imagine the type of person you want your character to be. Do you want them to be a courageous warrior? Maybe they’re a farmer who provides food for his close friends and family. Or perhaps you would like to play an ingenuitive engineer or crafty scavenger. Choose a background that best fits the type of character you would like to play.

Once you have an idea of the type of character you are going to play, the next step is to choose a species. Species are humanoid peoples with special attributes and characteristics related to each species. Maybe your character is in tune with plants, then an Ecotopian would be a great fit. Does your character yearn for the sky? Try making your character an Avenari. There are many options to choose from, each unique and offering different playstyles and experiences, don’t be afraid to experiment!

## Choose a Species

Each species is relatively humanoid and intelligent, though intelligence as well as physical characteristics vary by species. The species you choose contributes a lot to the identity of your character. It provides the general appearance and natural abilities of your characters but also provides a background for what they experienced prior to the campaign.

Each species has traits that it is adapted to providing it with an increase in an attribute(such as strength or agility), core skills(such as swimming or foraging), a unique ability no other species has, and a unique weakness that no other species has.

## Choose a background

Every character has a background, which determines their past, general skills, and attributes. Each background provides your character with 5 basic skills related to that background and a unique skill exclusive to that background.

Keep in mind that certain backgrounds are tied to specific territories, for example, it might not make sense for your character to be a Seed Keeper when they are from Karkorte, a territory wholly underwater and very distant from the Seed Vault.

## Determine Attributes

Much of what your character does and how they interact with the environment around them is determined by their attributes, there are six: Knowledge, Intuition, Strength, Agility, Personality, Health.

Each attribute can be of rank 0-5, starting at 0 when you first create your character. Distribute 12 points among these attributes as you wish. Keep in mind that ranks 1-3 cost 1 point and rank 4 costs 2 points. Rank 5 is not available at character creation.

## Skills and Equipment

Your chosen species and background each provide you with a set of five skills that your character is proficient in. You can allocate 10 points to your species skill set and 10 points to your background skill set respectively. Each skill can be rank 0-5, starting at rank 0. Ranks 1-3 cost 1 point respectively and rank 4 costs 2 points. Rank 5 is not available at character creation. Your character’s unique skill starts at rank 3 and cannot be improved further in character creation.

If your skills overlap to a great extent you can ask your GM if you can take extra skills of your choice, at the GM’s discretion. If there is minimal overlap, then you can still distribute the full 20 points(10 for each skill set).

## Finishing Touches

Once all the numerical parts are done, it is time to flesh out your character. Describe how they look, how they act, their personality, motivations, and anything else you can think of!
