It is many years into Earthâ€™s future. 10,000 AD to be exact. Rising sea levels have submerged much of the planet, and the few remaining land masses suffer from pollution and diminishing resources. Only a few continents remain, with Antarctica, South America, Australia, and Asia completely submerged and evolved into coral reefs. As the planet rapidly changed over the past millennia, so too did its inhabitants. Humans, as we think of them today, have become a minority on the planet they once dominated. In their stead, myriad new species have evolved to adapt to this ever changing environment. Survival is the name of the game for most civilizations, each experiencing unique challenges (as well as unique joys!). But can these civilizations learn to start working with each other towards a world that allows for more than just day-to-day survival? Can they ride the tides of change into a better future, or will they drown?
