## Backstory

No character exists in a vacuum or was brought forth into the world fully formed. To get a sense of who your character is, develop their backstory and consider how their experiences have shaped their thoughts and behaviors.

:::note[Consider]

-   What was their upbringing like?
-   What are their main personality traits?
-   What is their top 3 core values?
-   What is their biggest vice?
-   What motivates them?
-   What discourages them?

## Modifiers

Skills and attributes have the same modifiers based on rank, and these two modifiers are combined and added to the relevant check:
Rank 0 = -1, Rank 1 = 0, Rank 2 = +1, Rank 3 = +2, Rank 4 = +3, Rank 5 = +4
(E.g. A player has rank 4 in agility, and rank 3 in acrobatics, so in order to run across multiple rooftops in a city, they would add a total of +5 to their check).

## Attributes

Attributes rank 0-5. Players start at level 0 in all attributes and have 12 points to distribute among the attributes.

It costs one point to upgrade an attribute per rank until rank 3, then it costs 2 points to upgrade to rank 4. No attributes may be upgraded to rank 5 at character creation. Additional levels in rank can be accrued by spending 10 times the new level in XP (e.g. leveling an attribute from rank 4 to 5 would cost 50 XP))

-   Knowledge: How much does the character know? How good are they at figuring information out?
-   Intuition: How good is the character at reading people and situations? How perceptive are they? How accurate are their gut instincts?
-   Strength: How strong are they? How much can they lift? How hard can they hit? How high can they jump?
-   Agility: How fast can they move? How quick are their reactions? How sneaky can they be?
-   Personality: How charming are they? How scary? How good are they at persuasion, deception, or intimidation?
-   Health: How healthy are they? How well do they bounce back from injury and illness?

## Skills

Each species and background will both have five skills that are most relevant to distribute 10 points among (10 skills and 20 points total). No skills may be upgraded to rank 5 at character creation.

Additionally, each background has a unique starting skill not available on the core list that begins at rank 3 and may not be leveled up higher than that at creation. Leveling this skill up later in the game, though, works the same as any other.

Seed Keepers receive a skill known as PlantSpeak. This skill allows Seed Keepers to connect deeply with the natural energy of the world, sensing the health and stability of surrounding plants. They can create a temporary protective barrier around seeds or plants, protecting them from environmental hazards or physical threats. The shield preserves the vitality of the seeds.
