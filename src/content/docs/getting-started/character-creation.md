description: How to create a character in Tides of Change
---

## Backstory
No character exists in a vacuum or was brought forth into the world fully formed. To get a sense of who your character is, develop their backstory and consider how their experiences have shaped their thoughts and behaviors. 

:::note[Consider]
- What was their upbringing like?
- What are their main personality traits?
- What is their top 3 core values?
- What is their biggest vice?
- What motivates them?
- What discourages them?
:::




## Attributes in Tides of Change
Players start at **level 0** in all attributes and have **15 points** to distribute among the attributes, except for Karma, which starts at 0 and changes during game play at **GM’s discretion**.

Cost to upgrade an attribute is as follows:
- 1 point to upgrade an attribute per rank until rank 3
- 2 points to upgrade to rank 4
- No attributes can be upgraded to rank 5 at character creation


Additional levels in rank can be accrued by spending 10x the new level in XP to a max of **Rank 5.**

**Example:** leveling an attribute from rank 4 to 5 would cost 50XP

## Skills in Tides of Change
Each species and background will have five skills that are most relevant to distribute 10 points among (10 skills and 20 points total). Characters will start with an additional 5 points that can be distributed among any skills they choose. 
- Core skills that all species/backgrounds can develop: see list below
- \+ 1 unique background skill: TBD by group (some groups may come up with the same type of skill, and that’s fine, but it should just be unique from the core list below. Eg. maybe there’s an empathy skill that increases trust with other characters, or a forgery skill that allows for forging of documents or items, or a gardening skill that allows players to successfully grow plants, etc.)

Skills also rank in 0-5, with the same modifiers as attributes. To determine modifiers to dice rolls, players would combine the modifier for the relevant attribute and relevant skill. (E.g. A player has rank 4 in agility, and rank 3 in acrobatics, so in order to run across multiple rooftops in a city, they would add a total of +5 to their check). Skills can be leveled up by spending 5x new rank in XP (e.g. going from rank 3 to rank 4 would cost 20XP)

Increasing skills and attributes should not happen arbitrarily. They should reflect the experiences the character has. If you start with a rank 2 in strength, but don’t do anything in game play that could feasibly improve that strength score, it shouldn’t be leveled up. Conversely, if you’ve been doing a lot of hacking, you’re probably getting better at it, and so might choose to level up your cybernetics skill once you have enough points to do so.

**Species bonuses:**
- One extra point to a specific attribute
- Five relevant skills from the core list they can distribute 10 extra points among
- One unique ability (species-specific TBD by groups)
- One unique disadvantage or weakness (balance this, has to be fun)

**Background bonuses**
- Five skills from the core list they can distribute 10 extra points among
- One unique skill with a starting rank of 3 (background-specific TBD by each group)
- One unique expertise (background-specific TBD by each group, this should also be on the expertise tree)
- Three pieces of relevant gear/equipment
- One useful NPC connection (needs to be determined at character creation)
