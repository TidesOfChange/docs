## Frontier Gem Suite
When Frontier began the terraforming process of the mountain that would become the site of their headquarters, they discovered one of the world's crystals buried within. Although other societies would come to view the other crystals as sacred sites of spiritual pilgrimage, Frontier saw the crystal as an opportunity to develop new methods of expansion. In their research, they inadvertently cracked the massive crystal, destabilizing its effects and allowing them to develop unheard of technology. The new magi-tech devices, as they would come to be known, catalyzed an unprecedented period of expansion for Frontier. These devices utilized the life force of living matter to mimic the powers of spell casters. The most prominent of these devices is the Gem Suite, a suit of armor that allows the wearer to use magic with minimal training. 

Frontier eventually began to sell the Gem Suite to anyone wealthy enough to afford it. Of course, the biomass units that power the Gem Suite are only available through Frontier affiliated merchants, at least in theory keeping the users loyal to Frontier. In recent years, some of the Gem Suites have ended up in the possession of those actively resisting Frontier expansion. Theft of the biomass units has become a growing problem for Frontier as their own technology has been used against them in the far corners of the world. The Wanderers stage raids from their floating city and the natives of the Aeolian Archipelago attack Frontier outposts with increasing frequency.

There have also been rumors of more advanced prototypes - neural implants, cybernetics, and drug regimens with powers far beyond the Gem Suite. If such things exist, Frontier would surely keep them closely guarded and out of the dangerous hands of the public.
