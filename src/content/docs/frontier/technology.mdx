## Introducing the Frontier Gem Suite!

### Frontier Gem Suite
When Frontier began the terraforming process of the mountain that would become the site of their headquarters, they discovered one of the world's crystals buried within. Although other societies would come to view the other crystals as sacred sites of spiritual pilgrimage, Frontier saw the crystal as an opportunity to develop new methods of expansion. In their research, they inadvertently cracked the massive crystal, destabilizing its effects and allowing them to develop unheard of technology. The new magi-tech devices, as they would come to be known, catalyzed an unprecedented period of expansion for Frontier. These devices utilized the life force of living matter to mimic the powers of spell casters. The most prominent of these devices is the Gem Suite, a suit of armor that allows the wearer to use magic with minimal training. 

Frontier eventually began to sell the Gem Suite to anyone wealthy enough to afford it. Of course, the biomass units that power the Gem Suite are only available through Frontier affiliated merchants, at least in theory keeping the users loyal to Frontier. In recent years, some of the Gem Suites have ended up in the possession of those actively resisting Frontier expansion. Theft of the biomass units has become a growing problem for Frontier as their own technology has been used against them in the far corners of the world. The Wanderers stage raids from their floating city and the natives of the Aeolian Archipelago attack Frontier outposts with increasing frequency.

There have also been rumors of more advanced prototypes - neural implants, cybernetics, and drug regimens with powers far beyond the Gem Suite. If such things exist, Frontier would surely keep them closely guarded and out of the dangerous hands of the public.

## <u>Gem Suite Progression</u>
* Utility Series – Boots
* Level 1-2 – Gloves
* Level 3 – Pants
* Level 4 – Chest
* Level 5 – Helmet
* Level 6 – Experimental Neural Implant 

## Frontier Magitech Gear 1.0
Magic Wielding Gear that can be purchased from the Frontier Corp. It comes in 7 tiers: 
- 100c each for Utility Boots or Backpack (10 charges)
- 100c for one glove (3 charges)
- 200c for second glove (3 charges)
- 300c for pants (3 charges)
- 400c for chest (3 charges)
- 500c for helmet (3 charges)
- 1000c to unify the system (unifies them into 15 total charges that can be used at user’s discretion)

Each piece of equipment contains progressively more powerful tech. Unlike Crystal magic, it uses nano processing, to restructure atomic structures of materials creating desired effects.

Each spell used requires a biomass battery that can be either purchased from frontier or created by using biomass harvester (inject machine into ground to suction 50 square feet of biomass to recharge 3 batteries; machine takes 3 turns to produce 3 batteries). 

If batteries are unavailable, users can choose to create a spell using the organic transfer feature: perform any spell at the expense of **1 deep wound** (gives **1 harm**, but requires 2 healing).

### Backpack – “Utility Max” series (10 charges) 

_Light_

Create a 20 foot radius or a 100 x 5ft beam of light that originates from you and lasts up to one hour.

_Locate_ 
You procure a thin wire of silver light that leads you to a location that you know of, or can deduce. If you have never been to a location you are told of, you will have a 50/50 chance of making it where you want to go

_Repair_ 

You can use the crystal energy to restore the structure of a destroyed object. More complicated structures require additional charges. Additionally, you can repair any mechanism you made yourself or learned the instruction to. Trying to fix a mechanism you have never encountered can lead to unwanted side effects.

_Alarm_

Create a spell that can wake you up or warn you of danger in the vicinity. It presents itself as a loud ringing in the head. Higher levels increase the area of alarm by 100 feet per level. 

_Telepathy_

Create a message you can send to a willing creature. Unwilling creatures may roll a defense to resist the message.

_Firefly_

Create a small mote of fire that floats just above the palm of your hand. The mote can be used to light a small dark area, start a fire with kindling, or burn a target with a successful unarmed attack, dealing 1 harm + burn (1 harm every 2-3 turns). The Firefly is extinguished after ten minutes or until it meets a target.

_Air Bubble_

Create a number of charges in air bubbles around yourself and/or others. Air breathing species are able to breathe normally, with no penalties, while underwater with an air bubble. Lasts up to 8 hours. Alternatively, the bubble may also be cast on a non-air breathing species as an attack. Target must have hands free and succeed with a Force roll of 15 to pop the bubble. Otherwise it causes suffocation (1 harm that bypasses soak every 2-3 turns) *Can be used as utility spell*

_Water Bubble_

Create a number of charges in water bubbles around yourself and/or others. Water breathing species are able to breathe normally, with no penalties, while on land with a water bubble. Lasts up to 8 hours. Alternatively, the bubble may also be cast on a non-water breathing species as an attack. Target must have hands free and succeed with a Force roll of 15 to pop the bubble. Otherwise causes suffocation (1 harm  that bypasses soak every 2-3 turns) *Can be used as utility spell*

### Boots – “Utility Max” series (10 charges) 

_Waterglide_

Create a current or a hydroplaning effect between yourself and the water surface. It allows you to travel 2x as fast on the water or underwater. Lasts one hour.

_Glide_

You can cancel fall damage by generating an air pillow that slows your fall gradually.

_Fly_

Generate air currents to allow yourself the power of flight. You can travel 2x as fast in the air. Lasts ten minutes.

_Burrow_

Use the tech to transmute earth elements to create a tunnel leading in any direction. One use can generate 100 feet of tunnel. 

_Jet_

Combine with **Waterglide** or **Fly** to increase speed to 4x. 

_Traversing fire_

You can create a protective barrier allowing you to safely explore lava or other extremely hot territories.
