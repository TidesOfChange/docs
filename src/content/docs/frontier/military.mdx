## The Military of the Corp
As the influence of Frontier grew, they saw the need for armed capability and levied their own paramilitary force. Although originally meant to be temporary, the battalion quickly expanded and became a permanent fixture of the company. Today the Security Forces are stationed in Camp Hermann, a base near New Everest. Most of the enlistees are young people and migrants from the city who have no connections to the upper echelons of the company. 

The Security Force is a combination of volunteers and mandatory service draftees. Although portrayed to the public as a defensive entity, the primary mission of the Security Force has been supporting company expansion into the far corners of the world. These missions range from resource acquisition to forcibly integrating Frontier into foreign economies.
> *The alarm blared, and I snapped to attention. No hesitation. No thought. Just action.* <br />
<br /> *The training hall dissolved, and the jungle swallowed us whole. The Tangle of Delphi stretched endlessly, thick with vines and towering trees that strangled the sunlight. The air was wet, heavy, clinging to my skin like a second layer. Insects whined in my ears, and the ground beneath my boots was slick with rot. We had been warned—combat wasn’t the only danger here. Dehydration could kill just as easily as a bullet. Booby traps lay hidden beneath the foliage, waiting for a single misstep. Situational awareness. That was what mattered.* <br />
<br /> *"Instant obedience to all orders."* <br />
<br /> *The Instructor’s voice crackled in my earpiece. I gripped my rifle tighter, scanning the underbrush. Somewhere ahead, the enemy was waiting. Not civilians. Not protesters. Combatants. Threats to Frontier’s order. Threats to us. The command came. Advance.
I moved carefully, boots pressing into the damp moss without a sound. Step wrong, and a wire might snap, a pitfall might open. The others moved just as cautiously, eyes sweeping the trees, the undergrowth, the shadows between. Gunfire cracked through the jungle. I dropped to a knee, heart hammering. Figures moved ahead; ragged, undisciplined. They weren’t like us. They weren’t trained.* <br />
<br /> *I exhaled, aimed, fired. A target crumpled. I shifted position, sighted another. Keep moving. Keep pushing forward. We had been taught that hesitation was failure. And failure wasn’t an option.* <br />
<br /> *The jungle shimmered, then vanished. The towering trees faded into blank walls, the damp earth replaced by cold metal flooring. The scent of soil and sweat still clung to me as I lowered my weapon. The Instructor stepped forward, his face unreadable. * <br />
<br /> *“Again.”* <br />
<br /> *We would continue until fatigue set in, until all we had left was reflexes and instinct. Frontier saved our lives, gave us a refuge from the crumbling world, and serving in the Sec was how I could give back. It wasn’t glamorous, but it had more meaning than working a desk for the next forty years.*
