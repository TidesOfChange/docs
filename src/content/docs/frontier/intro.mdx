## Introduction

The origins of the mega-corporation known as Frontier are fiercely contested. All thatâ€™s known for certain is that in the aftermath of the climate apocalypse, numerous corporate entities formed a united front. Whether their intentions were to capitalize on the situation or to pool their resources to respond to the catastrophe is unknown, and perhaps irrelevant.

In the present day, Frontier is a monolithic corporation whose influence reaches every part of the planet. No one can truly pin down what it is that Frontier does, however. It seems to be in the business for just about everything. It sells just about every product imaginable, it has branches in every region of the world, and it seems to have an interest in anything that might generate value.

As a result, Frontier is a massive organization. The exact nature of its functions and purpose can vary from place to place, and indeed from situation to situation. However, what remains consistent are its baffling size, its hulking bureaucracy, and its unending drive to expand.

Different people take different stances on this MegaCorp. On the one hand, its ever expanding influence and involvement in shady activities is undeniable. On the other, it serves as an important provider of resources and information for many. As distasteful as Frontier is to some, the organization and structure it provides is absolutely essential for many. Further, Frontier is a breathtakingly massive organization inhabited by a multitude of people with different experiences and perspectives. For everything true of Frontier, the opposite holds true as well.

It ultimately falls on the player to determine how good or evil Frontier is for a given situation, and indeed for the world at large. However, between its economic dealings, its ever-expanding operations and its army of bioengineered weapons, the influence the Frontier corporation exerts over the new world from its seat at New Everest cannot be ignored.
