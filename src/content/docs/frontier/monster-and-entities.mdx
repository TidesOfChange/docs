### **The Rootbound** _(Ecotiopan – Arborian)_

Humanoid trees, forever frozen in painful incomplete growth. Spines are made of crystal-charged vines, constantly shifting in a state of agony. They hunt intruders, thinking they are corrupting the ecosystem (_a result of Frontier’s mental conditioning_).

**Abilities:**
- **Root Grab** – Grows entangling vines from the ground to trap enemies.  
- **Photosynthesis Drain** – Steals life force from nearby creatures to sustain itself.

**Weakness:** Fire-based attacks cause it to lose limbs and strength.
