## Entities in the Frontier ecosystem

As a result of its reach and muscle, Frontier has often found itself in the business of security technology and biotechnology. Listed below are some of these technologies and bioengineered entities. While most common in the more dangerous parts of New Everest, these entities (or at least their close cousins) can be found most places where Frontier has a strong foothold. Circumstances may dictate whether players fight with or against them…

<div> 

### **The Rootbound** _(Ecotiopan – Arborian)_

Humanoid trees, forever frozen in painful incomplete growth. Spines are made of crystal-charged vines, constantly shifting in a state of agony. They hunt intruders, thinking they are corrupting the ecosystem (_a result of Frontier’s mental conditioning_).

**Abilities:**
- **Root Grab** – Grows entangling vines from the ground to trap enemies.  
- **Photosynthesis Drain** – Steals life force from nearby creatures to sustain itself.

**Weakness:** Fire-based attacks cause it to lose limbs and strength.

### _Seer Hounds_ (Controlled Mobys)

Logistics specialists, turned into bio-computers for Frontier. Blind, floating horrors covered in crystal-charged sonar eyes. Frontier uses them to scan and predict movement, making escape nearly impossible. Their screams can alert other nearby corporate workers and security.

**Abilities:**
- **Echo Trap** – Detects and marks any living being within a 200-foot radius.  
- **Overload Pulse** – Emits a piercing shriek that stuns enemies but also harms itself.

**Weakness:** Can be silenced with disruptive sound or EMP interference.

<div>

### _Fungal Cube_ (Frontier’s Source of Biomass)

Mushroom-based cubes infected with experimental spores caused by a failed attempt of crystal infusion. They absorb anything they touch into their biomass. Created by Frontier to spread productivity, but they grew beyond control. Corporate researchers still try to use them for indefinite hostile takeovers.

**Abilities:**
- Hostile Takeover - Infects an enemy, forcing them to obey Frontier’s directives.
- Merge - Absorbs organic matter to grow bigger and stronger.

Weakness: If The Fungal Cube absorbs too much biomass too quickly, it becomes unstable and collapses under its own weight.

<div>

### _The Rat Brokers_ (Corporate Informants & Assassins)

Corporate spies that act as a collective swarm. Frontier’s bipedal Rats, implanted with hive-mind AI. Appear harmless but secretly gather data, betraying targets when convenient. Sacrifice themselves in swarms to achieve small victories.

**Abilities:**
- **Swarm Tactics** – Attack as a single entity, making them hard to hit individually.  
- **Pack Prioritization** – Immediately target anyone hoarding resources.

**Weakness:** If cut off from their pack, they become disorganized and flee.

<img src="/docs/public/frontier/Company_Worker.png" alt="Company Worker" style={{ width: '200px', height: 'auto' }} />

<div>

### _Company Worker_ (Workers Fused with Crystal Tech)

Humanoids with cracked, glowing bodies, pulsing with unstable crystal energy. Once human workers, now trapped in a permanent state of productivity, unable to stop moving. Emits static energy, causing technology to glitch when near.

</div>
</div>


**Abilities (Company Worker):**
- **Power Surge** – Unleashes a shockwave that fries nearby electronics and stuns organic beings.  
- **Endless Work Cycle** – When killed, it reanimates 12 hours later continuing its task as if nothing happened.

**Weakness:** If made aware, it self-destructs, unless players are able to convince it to rebel against Frontier.

## Technological Enhancements

### _The Loyalty Chip_ (Neural Contract Implant)

A biotech implant placed in employees and security personnel to ensure absolute compliance. Hardwired into the brain’s decision making processes, rewriting thoughts and memories. Higher ranked executives have override access, allowing them to control workers like puppets.

**Effects:**
- Employees cannot disobey orders from approved superiors.  
- Erases rebellious thoughts, replacing them with company approved goals.  
- The chip “self-destructs” (frying the brain) if tampered with.

**Weakness:** Head damage causes memory leaks, leading to occasional glitches or employees remembering their past lives and going rogue.

---

### _Krystaline: Bio-Stimulant_

A performance enhancing serum that temporarily boosts worker efficiency by injecting crystal infused energy into the bloodstream. Used on laborers, security forces, and combat mutants to work beyond human limits. Causes severe long term mutations, but Frontier does not disclose this side effect.

**Effects:**
- Grants superhuman speed, strength, or cognition for 12 hours.  
- Suppresses hunger, pain and exhaustion. It allows non stop work cycles.  
- When the effect wears off, the subject experiences violent withdrawals.

**Weakness:** Prolonged use causes irreversible mutation, transforming workers into monstrous, crystal-infused zombies.

---

### _Frontier Surveillance System_

A citywide surveillance network powered by Frontier’s crystal energy data servers. Records, predicts, and alters employee behavior based on AI driven projections (not always accurate). The corporation sees all, knows all, and enforces all.

**Effects:**
- Predicts crimes, rebelliousness, or sabotage before they happen by analyzing thought patterns and work efficiency reports.  
- Can override citywide security drones, dispatching enforcement before an incident occurs.  
- Public terminals encourage self-reporting, rewarding informants who expose inefficiency.

**Weakness:** The system is too reliant on crystal servers. If the energy flow is disrupted, the surveillance network collapses and needs to be rebooted.
