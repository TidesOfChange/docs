## Hierarchy
<img src="/src/assets/frontier/hierarchy.jpg" alt="Hierarchy" width="300" height="200" style="border:solid 1px black"/>
Frontier is a public company structured with shareholders in mind, which follows a chain of commands down the hierarchy. Shareholders may vote up the Board of Directors to represent their interests. Then, any major decisions made are put up to a vote by the Board of Directors. The Directors then pass down these decisions to Executive Officers to enforce. From there, the chain of command goes to middle management in which they oversee the department. Workers are at the lowest tier and are tasked with daily operations depending on their department. Lastly, security or military soldiers are essentially employees with greater access throughout the Frontier headquarters.

##### *Board of Directors*
The Directors have the highest authority within Frontier and can enact broad agendas downwards of the hierarchy. They may vote in and oversee the executive officers.

##### *Workers*
Individuals who have nowhere else left to work. Due to limited housing and expensive rent, they are forced to work and live at Frontier. Everyday, workers wake up in their Frontier-owned housing to commute to work. All money they earn will be used to buy groceries and products back from Frontier. A never-ending extraction of wealth prevents workers from digging themselves out of their hole. But at least they can walk to work!

## Culture
Frontier’s corporate culture is primarily defined by its demands for conformity. The sheer scale of its operations means that there are countless layers of bureaucracy for every task imaginable. Going off-script, even if this means taking fruitful initiative, runs a high risk of agitating the bureaucracy and causing chaos within the machine. As such, most employees have it beaten into them that they need to follow orders and keep their heads down.
