## Hierarchy
<img src="/src/assets/frontier/hierarchy.jpg" alt="Hierarchy" width="400" height="300" style="border:solid 1px black"/>
Frontier is a public company structured with shareholders in mind, which follows a chain of commands down the hierarchy. Shareholders may vote up the Board of Directors to represent their interests. Then, any major decisions made are put up to a vote by the Board of Directors. The Directors then pass down these decisions to Executive Officers to enforce. From there, the chain of command goes to middle management in which they oversee the department. Workers are at the lowest tier and are tasked with daily operations depending on their department. Lastly, security or military soldiers are essentially employees with greater access throughout the Frontier headquarters.

##### *Board of Directors*
The Directors have the highest authority within Frontier and can enact broad agendas downwards of the hierarchy. They may vote in and oversee the executive officers.

* ​​Chair of the Board
    * The official leader of the Board who guides the direction of Frontier
* Vice Chair of the Board
    * The second in command of the Board
* Secretary
    * The paper-filer, assistant, receptionist, and other roles that other Directors avoid
* Treasurer
    * The money person who sets the budget
* Investor Director: (Wealthy) Shareholder
    * A wealthy individual who represents the concerns of other wealthy shareholders
* Executive Director: CFO of the C-Suite
    * The director who is also the CFO of the Executive Officers
    * Represents the voices or concerns from the Executive Officers
* Employee Representative Director: Insider
    * A high-ranking middle manager who represents the concerns of the employees

##### *Executive Officers*
The Officers execute high level orders from the Directors by delegating tasks to the middle managers of a department. 

* CEO: Chief Executive Officer
    * The head of the C-Suite
* CFO: Chief Financial Officer
    * They audit spending and mitigate risks 
* COO: Chief Operating Officer
    * They operate business logistics and efficiency
* CTO: Chief Technology Officer
    * They drive tech innovations
* CMO: Chief Marketing Officer
    * They engage with public relations
* CISO: Chief Information Security Officer
    * They strengthen security and cybersecurity
* CSO: Chief Strategy Officer
    * They ensure market adaptability and opportunities

##### *Management*
Middle managers each lead their respective departments and oversee lower management. Front-line managers will directly supervise and evaluate their workers.

* Sales Department
    * Distributes products and services within the region
* Research and Development Department
    * Develops projects and secrets
* Expansion Department
    * Directs further expansion of the corporation
* Paramilitary
    * Commands their security forces
* Other Departments
    * They are found in other regions and can be further explored by players

##### *Workers*
Individuals who have nowhere else left to work. Due to limited housing and expensive rent, they are forced to work and live at Frontier. Everyday, workers wake up in their Frontier-owned housing to commute to work. All money they earn will be used to buy groceries and products back from Frontier. A never-ending extraction of wealth prevents workers from digging themselves out of their hole. But at least they can walk to work!

## Culture
Frontier’s corporate culture is primarily defined by its demands for conformity. The sheer scale of its operations means that there are countless layers of bureaucracy for every task imaginable. Going off-script, even if this means taking fruitful initiative, runs a high risk of agitating the bureaucracy and causing chaos within the machine. As such, most employees have it beaten into them that they need to follow orders and keep their heads down. 

##### *Myth of Tenure*
Frontier is infamous for its Myth of Tenure: employees are constantly reminded that staying loyal and following orders will eventually be rewarded with career development, encouraging them to continue feeding the conformity that keeps the bureaucracy alive. Most workers at Frontier buy into this idea, or least fall in line with it.

Importantly the Myth of Tenure is not intentional or malicious propaganda spread by the corporation. Rather, it is a natural response to the circumstances by individuals. At lower levels, it is undeniably true that loyalty and obedience are rewarded by piecemeal promotions. This encourages senior employees at Frontier to keep repeating the Myth to newcomers: it is easy to buy into because it is partially true, but more importantly, spreading the Myth simplifies their work. 

So long as the Myth is maintained and propagated, workers are made to comply with their managers and seniors. This makes it easier for the latter groups to maintain control and finish their mundane tasks efficiently. Quite simply, there is no reason to go off-script and encourage any heroics that might upset the machine. After all, very few people actually want to be there.

As such, the culture of conformity and the strict procedures that maintain Frontier’s bureaucracy are self-reinforcing. Workers are disenfranchised by it, but they are also actively maintaining it.

Beyond the largely ceremonial promotions that keep menial workers motivated, actual progression in the Frontier hierarchy requires connections. You realistically will need connections (through nepotism or cronyism) or capital (a few fat stacks) to influence or bribe your way to a higher position. In other words, you need to get underhanded to get ahead of the game.

The only way for those without funds or influence to progress is through exceptionally strong results. However, this requires taking initiative and breaking from norms. Such actions are considered high-risk, high-reward, as you are practically guaranteed to be fired if you fail, but if you succeed, you might be able to improve your life (assuming they consider your results a meaningful counterbalance to your insubordination). Hence, it is not impossible to break from the status quo, but it is simply too risky to tempt your average, uninterested Frontier drone.

##### *Management*
Due to the cold reality of career progression, Frontier’s middle management tends to be filled with incompetent crony candidates. The middle levels tend to be the least effective because they are the least accountable: most of the workers at these levels are too influential to be fired, but also not important enough to monitor nor capable enough to promote. 

Upper management is also dominated by crony candidates, but it tends to consist of the more competent of the bunch. Unlike middle managers who go largely unsupervised or unchecked, upper management (and particularly the CEO) are answerable to the Board of Directors, requiring them to be at least relatively good at their job (refer to the [Hierarchy](#hierarchy) section). Neutral observers find them more reasonable and personable than most, but they still strike some as out of touch (refer to the [Attitudes](#attitudes) section). 

## Attitudes
On New Everest, there tends to be a huge difference in the perceptions of the working class and the upper class. In spite of the wide array of people that fall somewhere in the middle of the spectrum, disparities in wealth and influence are wide enough that it wouldn’t be inaccurate to say that there are two different societies coexisting on New Everest.

##### *The Working Class*
For the most part, the average citizen of New Everest’s proletariat takes no issue with their conditions. Almost everyone thinks that they’re “middle class”, irrespective of where they actually are on the corporate ladder. There’s always someone better off and always someone worse off, but most people in New Everest cling to the comfort of the latter over the oppression of the former.

Some workers complain about their situation, but most are content with stable work. Frontier makes no effort to censor or silence criticism. If anything, it would rather that criticism become so commonplace that no one takes the issues seriously anymore; they fade into banal water boiler talk. 

It doesn’t help that most workers are often inundated with endless consumerism. Any demand that they might have is catered to at every price point. They work for Frontier, then spend all their money on Frontier products. Working and living conditions are stable and reliable, almost to a dehumanizing extent. It’s easy to grow content with stability, but can such acceptance truly be considered satisfaction?

Some people who have been thoroughly disavowed or disenfranchised by the system tend to be more in touch with their frustrations. These are the people who Frontier keeps track of in earnest, because they are the most dangerous by far… It remains to be seen what they might achieve on New Everest.

##### *The Upper Class*
Those that are higher up in the social ladder don’t truly need to work. Neither their sustenance or influence are in any threat, but most individuals from such families choose to plunge into corporate work anyways. Maybe they have nothing better to do, or maybe they think they’re well suited for the task.

New Everest’s upper class generally believes in merit. They would have you believe that Frontier operates on a strictly meritocratic basis, and that they are where they are because they’re better suited for the tasks that come their way. As much as they’d point at your bootstraps, however, they are not completely naive.

Ironically enough, it is largely the upper class that takes notice of the disparities and issues plaguing New Everest. Many are quick to complain about inequity and propose solutions. It’s difficult to say whether this comes from a genuine or paternalistic place. Perhaps both. 

Many corporate bigwigs spend much of their time suggesting improvements to infrastructure and welfare systems. Some of these people care about improving people’s lives. Some people simply think they’re better suited to guide those beneath them. Arguably, their motivations don’t matter. However, by improving conditions within the confines of the system, they can easily shut down criticisms of it. Many denizens of the upper class want things to improve, but it remains to be seen how much they want things to change.

## Characters
##### *The CEO*
<img src="/src/assets/frontier/ceo.PNG" alt="CEO" width="300" height="200" />
Xavier Stoneweller believes himself to be a hardworking individual. However, his wealth and connections contributed to his climb up the social ladder. Most workers agree that he is out-of-touch with the idea of meritocracy and is married to the myth of his own competence.

Before his title as CEO, he was once a CEO for a produce company, which inevitably was bought out by Frontier. Interestingly, the Directors agreed to hire him back as a CEO for Frontier. Since the acquisition, he never questioned the orders from the Directors and has taken a proactive stance to dismantling Frontier’s bureaucracy.

##### *Middle Manager*
Donald Kingsley was a man who understood the value of routine and control. At 51, he had spent years maneuvering through the corporate landscape, knowing exactly how to position himself for success. As the Public Relations Manager at Frontier, his job was simple: maintain the company's image, expand its reach, and make sure the right people knew his name. He didn’t need to question the purpose of his work—he didn’t need to know why he was doing it, just that it had to be done. The corporate machine ran on obedience, and Donald had long mastered the art of following the rules while quietly shaping the game to his advantage.

He was skilled in the art of appearances, projecting a friendly, approachable persona to workers while subtly undermining middle management. To the executives and shareholders, he was nothing short of a loyal ally, always ready to flatter, always pushing for the next step up the ladder. There was little room for weakness in his world—cowardice, hesitation, or failure were risks he couldn’t afford. His ambition was straightforward, his goals clear: climb the ladder, spread Frontier’s influence, and keep moving forward. It was a cycle, one he’d accepted long ago. After all, in a world like this, what else could you do?
