## How Do Checks work in Tides of Change?
Players will roll a **d20** and add relevant modifiers to determine their success in specific checks. Modifiers are determined by ranks in attributes and skills and/or by special talents or abilities based on the descriptions of those abilities.

Certain checks with NPCs or opponents might require an opposed check by the GM. For example, your sneakiness vs. their awareness, your force vs theirs in a wrestling match, your deception vs. their insight.

Some checks might have an **advantage** or a **disadvantage** to them, based on specific abilities or conditions in the game, as determined by the GM. For advantages, roll two d20s and take the higher score. For disadvantages, roll two d20s and take the lower score.

GMs will determine the success threshold for various checks based on difficulty, but can use the following suggested threshold:

:::note[Example]
- 1: Critical fail, regardless of modifier
- 2-9: Fail
- 10-13: Success with consequences
- 14+: Success
- 20: Critical success, regardless of modifier
:::

> Ties go to the defender.

## Die Needed
Dice needed to play this game consist primarily of a **d20**, and in some cases, a **d6**. 
- **D20s** will be used for all checks in game - both skill checks and combat.
- **D6s** will be used to determine damage from combat and how much health is restored with healing. 

## Check Subcategories

> ##### Combat Checks
For combat, a d20 (+relevant attack modifiers) will be used to determine if a target is hit. A certain amount of d6s (based on weapon or attack type) will be rolled to determine amount of damage the target takes. 

Characters will have a certain level of defense that an attack check needs to exceed in order to cause damage.  Some characters might have extra dodge or evasion skills based on their abilities.

> ##### Health/Harm Checks
- Each species starts with **10 + rank** in health hit points.
- Health can be restored through the use of first aid/med kits, healing spells, and/or rest

Damage from combat encounters or accidents are determined by a certain number of d6s. That total is then subtracted from the HP maximum. Amount of 6s are determined by weapon type. Unarmed attacks should be determined by the force modifier divided by 2, rounded up (eg, with a strength of 3 and a force of 2, thatâ€™s a +3 modifier, meaning 2 damage). Most basic weapons might be 1d6. Better weapons might be 2 or 3d6. Taking a turn to aim or get in a favorable position might add another d6. 

Certain conditions may also arise in the game that could impose different damages or penalties. For example, spending a lot of time around a factory emitting heavy emissions might result in respiratory conditions that temporarily decrease your health or strength rank, or getting drugged might temporarily decrease your knowledge rank, or getting blinded by something might temporarily give you disadvantage on skill checks that rely on eyesight, etc. This should be narrative and at the GMs discretion.
