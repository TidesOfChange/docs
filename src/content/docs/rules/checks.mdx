Dice needed to play this game consist primarily of a **d20**, and in some cases, a **d6**. **D20s** will be used for all checks in game - both skill checks and combat.

Players will roll a d20 and add relevant modifiers to determine their success in specific checks. Modifiers are determined by ranks in attributes and skills and/or by special expertises or abilities based on the descriptions of those things.

Certain checks with NPCs or opponents might require an opposed check by the GM. For example, your sneakiness vs. their awareness, your force vs theirs in a wrestling match, your deception vs. their insight.

Some checks might have extra bonuses added to them, based on specific abilities or conditions in the game, as determined by the GM.

GMs will determine the success threshold, after modifiers are added, for various checks based on difficulty, but can use the following suggested threshold:

-   **Critical fail:** 1 on the die, regardless of modifier
-   **Fail:** 2-9
-   **Success with Consequences:** 10-13
-   **Success:** 14+
-   **Critical Success:** 20 on the die, regardless of modifier

Ties go to the defender.
