## Harm Threshold
- Each species starts with a harm threshold of 5 + their rank in Health. This is how many times they may be hit before falling unconscious and requiring immediate medical attention. 
- Some types of armor and clothing may add additional harm soaking that will be subtracted from an attack’s total before the remaining harm is passed onto the character.

## Taking Harm
- Damage from combat encounters or accidents have preset harm amounts. 
- To calculate damage from a hit, first subtract the harm soaking from any defensive gear being worn, then add the remaining damage to the character.

## Attacks
Attacks come in 2 forms
 
**Unarmed Attacks**
- Should be determined by the Force modifier divided by 2, rounded down (eg, with a Strength of 3 and a Force of 2, that’s a +3 modifier, meaning 1 harm).
- Unarmed strikes can do a max damage of 3 harm.

**Weapon Attacks**
- (Such as a Knife or a Club) will deal 1 harm. Better or more lethal weapons (such as a Sword or a Firearm) might be 2 or 3 harm.
- Taking a turn to aim or get in a favorable position could add an additional attack bonus or harm at GM’s discretion.

## Healing
Health can be restored through the use of first aid/med kits, healing spells, and/or rest. 

Each player always recovers up to their rank in health harm every full sleep. 

Use of first aid kits require a skill check that determines how much harm is healed: for most players and kits, this will be 2 harm for every 5 in a basic medicine check total (minimum 2 unless a critical failure is rolled) (eg. a medicine roll total of 8, with a +4 modifier, totalling 12 for the check, would heal 4 harm). Certain improved first aid kits may offer additional healing. First aid kits may only be used until supplies are exhausted, and then must be replenished.

A basic medicine check __*without*__ use of a kit, using whatever improvised supplies are around, heals 1 harm for every 5 in the check total (minimum 1 unless a critical failure is rolled).


## Conditions
Certain conditions may also arise in the game that could impose different damages or penalties. For example, spending a lot of time around a factory emitting heavy emissions might result in respiratory conditions that temporarily decrease your health or strength rank, or getting drugged might temporarily decrease your knowledge rank, or getting blinded by something might temporarily impose a penalty on skill checks that rely on eyesight, etc. This should be narrative and at the GM’s discretion.
