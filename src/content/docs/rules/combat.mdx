## Turn Order
- Who acts first goes in order of who has the highest combined agility/reaction modifier. 
- In the event of ties, roll a **d20** and the higher number goes first. 
- To keep from the same people always going in the same order, though, each new round, players may decide to move their turn lower in order to let other players go before them. This allows for more narrative collaboration. 
- They cannot, however, subvert opponents' reactions in this way (though the opponent may decide to lower their own turn order).

## Turn actions
Each turn may consist of one combat action (attack or spell), one movement (which includes falling prone, standing up, taking cover, or jumping or climbing onto something), and one skill check or equivalent. 

Certain abilities or expertises may allow for multiattack. What can be done in a turn in each of these categories should narratively make sense for the encounter and players’ abilities. There are no strict mechanics for movement in this game, but if needed in a combat encounter, multiply the character’s rank in agility by 10 for amount of feet of movement per turn. 

A player’s turn may also be spent helping another player or preparing to respond to something with a specific trigger determined 

:::note[Example]
I'm going to spend my turn distracting this enemy so that another player can have advantage on their attack, or I'm going to prepare to dodge if I'm targeted by an attack, or I'm going to shoot as soon as this enemy gets within range, or I'm going to take extra time to aim to bypass armor.

## Attacks
- For combat attacks, roll a **d20** and add the modifier for Strength + Force if melee, or Agility + Shooting if ranged. 
- A certain amount of harm (based on weapon or attack type) will be deducted from the target’s harm threshold, minus any harm soaked by armor.

## Defense
- Characters do not have a threshold that needs to be exceeded in order to land a hit. Instead, it is on the attacker to succeed in their attack role following the default thresholds. However, a GM may decide to increase the difficulty threshold on certain targets or add penalties to attack roles (such as for taking partial cover, or fighting in low-visibility conditions). 
- Ways characters CAN defend themselves is either through armor that soaks a number of harm before any remaining are passed onto the character, or through taking a Dodge action to try and evade the attack (which must be accounted for in the “attack” portion of the player’s turn that round - i.e. a player may not both attack and dodge an attack in the same round unless they have an ability or expertise that allows them to do so).
