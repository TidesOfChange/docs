## Turn Order
- Who acts first goes in order of who has the highest combined agility/reaction modifier. 
- In the event of ties, roll a **d20** and the higher number goes first. 
- To keep from the same people always going in the same order, though, each new round players may decide to move their turn lower in the order to let other players go before them. This allows for more narrative collaboration. 
- They cannot, however, subvert opponents' reactions in this way (though the opponent may decide to lower their own turn order).

## Turn actions
Each turn may consist of one combat action (attack or spell), one movement (which includes falling prone, standing up, taking cover, or jumping or climbing onto something), and one skill check. 

Certain abilities or expertises may allow for multiattack. What can be done in a turn in each of these categories should narratively make sense for the encounter and players’ abilities. There are no strict mechanics for movement in this game, but if needed in a combat encounter, multiply the character’s rank in agility by 10 for amount of feet of movement per turn. 

A player’s turn may also be spent helping another player or preparing to respond to something with a specific trigger determined 

:::note[Example]
I'm going to spend my turn distracting this enemy so that another player can have advantage on their attack, or I'm going to prepare to dodge if I'm targeted by an attack, or I'm going to shoot as soon as this enemy gets within range, or I'm going to take extra time to aim and increase my damage dice by 1.

## Attacks
- For combat attacks, roll a **d20** and add the modifier for Force if melee, or Shooting if ranged. 
- A certain amount of **d6s** (based on weapon or attack type) will be rolled to determine amount of damage the target takes. 

## Defense
- Characters have a certain level of defense that an attack check needs to exceed in order to cause damage.
- A character’s defense starts at a base 10 + their reaction modifier + any additional armor or defense-granting objects. Some characters might have extra dodge or evasion skills based on their abilities.
