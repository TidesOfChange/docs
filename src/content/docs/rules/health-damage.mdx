## Hit Points
- Each species starts with 10 + rank in health hit points. 
- To increase health, players can spend 10XP, no more than once per session, to add their rank in health in additional hit points.

## Taking Damage
- Damage from combat encounters or accidents are determined by rolling a certain number of **d6s** and adding the attack attribute modifier (Strength or Agility) to the total. 
- That total is then subtracted from the HP maximum. Amount of **d6s** are determined by weapon or damage type. 

## Attacks
Attacks come in 2 forms
 
**Unarmed Attacks**

Should be determined by the force modifier divided by 2, rounded up (eg, with a Strength of 3 and a Force of 2, that’s a +3 modifier, meaning 2 damage). 

**Weapon Attacks**

(Such as a knife or a club) will deal 1 **d6** damage. Better or more lethal weapons (such as a sword or a firearm) might be 2 or 3 **d6**. Taking a turn to aim or get in a favorable position could add another **d6**. 

## Healing
Health can be restored through the use of first aid/med kits, healing spells, and/or rest. 

Each player always recovers up to their rank in health **x3** HP every full sleep. 

Use of first aid kits require a skill check that determines how much health is restored: for most players and kits, this will be 3 HP for every 5 in a basic medicine check total (minimum 3) (eg. a medicine **d20** roll of 12, with a +4 modifier, totalling 16 for the check, would restore 9 HP). Certain improved first aid kits may offer additional healing. First aid kits may only be used until supplies are exhausted, and then must be replenished. 

A basic medicine check without use of a kit, using whatever improvised supplies are around, restores 1 HP for every 5 in the check total (minimum 1).


## Conditions
Certain conditions may also arise in the game that could impose different damages or penalties. For example, spending a lot of time around a factory emitting heavy emissions might result in respiratory conditions that temporarily decrease your health or strength rank, or getting drugged might temporarily decrease your knowledge rank, or getting blinded by something might temporarily give you disadvantage on skill checks that rely on eyesight, etc. This should be narrative and at the GM’s discretion.
