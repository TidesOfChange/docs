Even though all territories might not subscribe to a system of currency, or may have their own internal system, there is a universal currency that is typically accepted at all places in the form of digital credits. Physical money no longer exists, but many items can also often be created with foraged supplies and successful Mechanics checks, or traded for.

All characters start with basic necessities - clothes suitable for their environment/background, basic everyday supplies, a modest dwelling of a sort appropriate to the environment, etc. - as well as 100c.

Backgrounds start with an additional three pieces of specific gear for characters.
