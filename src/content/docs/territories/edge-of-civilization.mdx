> “I am going to put an end to all people, for the earth is filled with violence because of them. I am surely going to destroy both them and the earth. So make yourself an ark…” - (Genesis 6:13-14, NIV)

Old biblical texts claim life on earth was saved from a great flood aboard a boat big enough to fit two of all the planet's species. When these great tides returned to once again drown all living beings, man once again escaped extinction on a great ship. Atop these great new seas an Ark drifts. Its history, etched into walls of closely guarded hallways, is unknown to many. Maintenance, the religious organization that acts as the nervous system of the great ship, would claim that instructions for the Ark came direct from the mouth of god. In whispered breaths some argue that it was the same ingenuity and greed for life that led the earth being flooded inspired man to create the Ark. Whether it was life imitating art, or divine intervention, there is little doubt that the Ark was a saviour for the many species of the earth.

Home to people who became known as the Wanderers, the Ark acts as a mobile country. It is speculated the people who were saved on the vessel were the laborers who built it, which has inspired the culture on board. With scarce resources and constant threats to their home, the Wanderers have little room for those who aren’t willing and able to work. A meritocracy developed through the centuries, creating a transactional society where power and resources are directed to the most successful scavengers and craftsmen.

Wandering society is separated into two main sects, the Wayfarers and Citizens. Wayfarers make their keep on the waters and shores of the new world. They use skiffs originally constructed from scalped excess parts from the interior of the arc. On these narrow ships, found families are formed as small parties of Wanderers search for food and resources they can trade back aboard the ark. Many Wayfarers host short expeditions, aiming for smaller hauls and easier campaigns. To keep up with the stiff tax demands of the ark however, these crews have to hold missions far more frequently. There are some who spend as long as years away from the ark building out mobile infrastructure so larger animals and equipment can be transported. Wandering ports were established to act as a landing point for Wayfaring campaigns into the lands, and evolved into mobile trading posts with the various survivors of the land. What started as small stashes in elevated locations became ‘Standing Sites,’ the few stationary land ports where Wayfarers can be found. These stationary sites act as forward operating bases for scavenging missions deep into land locked territories.

While these structures outside of the ark represent great cooperation by Wayfarers, they aren’t always so friendly. While their meritocracy allows for social mobility, it asks little questions about the means of their achievements. While any destruction of Ark property, including Wayfaring skiffs, is frowned upon and frequently results in banishment, it is fairly common to be attacked by other bands of Wanderers looking to steal the glory of another's voyage. Contracts are drafted before campaigns depart detailing what each party member is responsible for and entitled to which was established to minimize internal conflicts within a Wayfaring party. These factors combined to the creation of Wandering Families, closed off groups of Wayfarers who stick together. Despite the name, they aren’t always blood relatives but instead are just the tight knit communities who brave the new world together. Most families are limited in size by the number of ships they have, and open spots in crews are very often limited, forcing many blood families to be split up into different crews. Accordingly, Wayfarers born on the Ark aren’t given a last name. Once someone has achieved some kind of great feat, they earn the name of their Wandering family.

While the Ark is the wayfarers true home, because space is so limited and need for fresh resources is always so great, few get to spend more than a few months at a time on the ark. Despite spending so much time in the wastes as desperate scavengers, they remain committed to supplying the ark so that their children and future generations may have a relatively safe place to grow up. Any permanent adult resident must commit themselves to working on the ship in roles such as mechanic, doctor, and cattleman.

Called Citizens, these laborers are responsible for making sure the Ark stays afloat and that the members on board stay healthy and educated. Over the centuries as digital logs and paper records became novelties of the past, the ship's history had to be painted, or sometimes even carved, onto the walls. The janitors of the ships have accordingly taken a greater role as historians and teachers. While Wayfarers organize themselves around the best scavengers, the Citizens have formed a more egalitarian society centered around worshiping the Ark. They believe the Ark is more than a ship, but itself a type of living being. To work on the ship is to work in direct service of a god.

Over seeing the Citizens and all activity on the Ark, a small council known simply as Maintenance captains the ship. Going only by moniker's like The Engineer, The Doctor, and the Cleaner; access to this exclusive council is restricted to those who have performed the greatest acts of service for the Ark. They exert strict control over the ship, as well as the Wanderers resource supply. Wandering ships are allocated to families according to the council, they are in charge of rationing the basic food supply out to Citizens, and members of Maintenance are the ones responsible for setting the ship's course.

Call Maintenance. A simple enough phrase that can carry dire consequences. As the only real form of institutionalized power among the citizens, Maintenance is responsible for enforcing order on the Ark. Exiles are common for even slight crimes, and Citizens who fail when given large responsibilities are frequently never heard from again. It is expected that a member will be replaced when someone else performs a feat greater than the current member. However, in the past there have been many instances of members of maintenance suppressing others in a bid to hold onto their power status. Punishable by exile, these acts of greed are considered the worst betrayal of the Wanderers and their beliefs. While there hasn’t been an official case of successor stifling in decades, constant suspicion persists of various members as there is no political mechanism to investigate current members.

While its cold metallic halls sheltered its creators and their descendents, it offered little in the way of comforts. Much like the Ark of legends, it was populated with many species of animals with an agricultural wing dedicated to maintaining a semi stable food source. While at first some of the animals were recklessly butchered, it became clear that the animals simply couldn't reproduce fast enough to waste any through slaughter. While you can find some rare old-earth animal products such as eggs, milk, and wool aboard, an animal's meat is saved only for the most elite Wayfarers and Members of Maintenance as a reward for particularly rare finds or technical feats on board the ship. To slaughter an animal that is not sick or fatally wounded is considered sacrilegious and would result in banishment from the Ark.

After bouts of mass starvation in the first decades of the ship, protein condensers were invented to convert insects into a space efficient food source. Amorphous protein blobs are the most plentiful food onboard the ark, while the Wayfarers bring in a fluctuating supply of food sources from the various flora and fauna of the dark seas. An entry tithe is expected from all returning Wayfarers in the form of algae which is used as food for the bug farms. This prevents the Ark from ever staying truly stationary, as there is a constant need for more feed to keep their food supply alive.

## The Edges of Civilization

There lies much untouched and undiscovered of this ever-changing world. Tectonic plates are discordant. Lands float off into islands, and they sink just as quickly beneath the ocean. Most of life is centralized, populating around the last surviving major land masses. However, there is a place where things–places are led to drift by the raging currents. An amalgamation of islands clustered around the edges of the world. The outside mists that ever-so-loom the far horizons Karkorte, Gronn Verden, Sylvangrove, Lumea, and the Aeolian Archipelago. A burgeoning wasteland that bubbles and festers with potential. A ring of unknown territories and forgotten things, this area is as valuable as it is dangerous. Not many make the journey across, and those that do often succumb to the dangers that lurk underwater. However, in pockets where the mists have settled for a short moment, islands bustle with trade and whispers of a history that has remained, still.

These islands move with the waves and shifting land masses, with large hulls and sails, a surviving humanity called the Wanderers survive on boats. They dock on ports, scavenge the land, and come back to the vehicles that they have engineered to help them survive against the tides. Outsiders have a harder time surviving, but some lucky few reap its rewards. This land is constantly shifting, with the most important piece of equipment being cartography tools and a map, with each individual making their own unique markers. Each meeting with another a chance to revise and share information, add new lands, track environmental dangers, and write in new places. Through each change of the landscape, more of the Old Earth is unveiled, more scrap to build upon Wandering ships gets washed on shore, and more sustenance for this struggling nomadic civilization of humans gets hidden deep within the misty lands. And the tides always bring in change.

## Environments

The Edge is comprised of diverse environments:

-   Trash yards & Dumping grounds
    -   These overflowing landfills are the most inhospitable area of the land. The ground is not stable, no structures can be built, no vegetation, no water. These trash yards give back to the people in a way of harboring useful materials and tools, the wanderers must go searching for these items though, which is no easy feat.
-   Desert lands
-   Bleached coral coasts
-   Polluted marshes
-   Disturbed waters and oil spills (radiated, lots of marine activity)

## Creatures

The Edge is also home to a wide variety of creatures and monsters:

-   Wastehowls that gather around trash yards
-   Toxic ooze monsters from oil
-   Sea monsters
-   Eldritch/infected fish (multiple eyes, rotten scales)
-   Tiny walking mushrooms
-   Bugs such as cockroaches and ants, earthworms, caterpillars, as well as snakes (some with a strange venom, some completely harmless)
-   The Bilipede: A gigantic centipede/millipede mix that breaks through the ground–3 feet long. Does not attack unless agitated

## Resources

-   Old military rations
-   Algae
-   Bugs
-   Fungi
-   Fish
-   Protein bars (blocks)
-   Canned food, preserved food, old cans of soda
-   Artifacts of old earth, mechanical parts, scraps

## The Wastelands

### A land that feels

> “You will possess their land; I will give it to you as an inheritance, a land flowing with milk and honey. I am the Lord your God ...” [Leviticus 20:24]
> The wastelands are what most call these accumulations of land–though, trash would better suffice to describe its surface. Large masses of plastic and still breaking-down materials create a rough environment that Wanderers have learned to weave through. Some areas of land are compact, cracked, and arid, with some of the trash melding into what is left of the soil. Some areas are marsh-like, with pockets of polluted waters and oil spills. Buried treasure rests within these trash piles–things useful to survival. Canned food, resurfaced vending machines with syrupy drinks, spare mechanical parts, or a part of the old world’s history. This land is what feeds Wanderers and allows for their constant struggle to survive. However, this land also feeds on Wanderers themselves, with unlucky ones sinking and swallowed by the marsh, or killed by the dangerous wildlife.

This land, as dictated by The Ark’s authorities, is promised to hold enough of the Old World to recreate it. A land of milk and honey…where humanity can thrive once again.

### Standing Sites

#### _Mountains and Molehills_

Elevated areas happen to be the safest and most stable. Wanderers of the past have found mountains that have withstood the test of time, with some setting their establishments for vagrants, refugees, and anyone looking for a place to rest. Here lies the few buildings in the Wastelands that are not yet eroded by history filled with establishments and places of recreation. These areas are more diversely populated with Wanders and mutant species alike, which more skeptical Wanders avoid for this reason. These are neutral grounds, non-affiliated with The Ark. Many businesses use supplies traded or raided from Frontier, hence its higher quality of offerings compared to the rest of the Wasteland and its waters. Wayfarers or refugees looking for riskier jobs often do work in supplying these establishments with ingredients or materials as it provides a hefty pay. Though these sites can be made-up on the spot or flavored to homebrew campaigns, some sample sites are.

#### _The Canteen_

Atop a flattened hill rests a bustling village of heat and aromas. Flavor is found here. Many Wanderers visit the Canteen to get in a good meal before a life of eating protein blocks and strange fish.

#### _The Junkyard_

A grungy place for drinking and gambling. A site with bars, casinos, and black-market exchanges.

### Wandering Ports

#### _A temporary anchor point_

Wandering ports often change to fit the Wasteland’s shape. Many are destroyed naturally by monsters or crashing tides. Wanderers fixate their ships on the most stable points of the Wasteland coasts, where the mists are most clear. They build these temporary ports as rest stops, supplies, and trade. Though it is rare for more than one ship to occupy a port (partly due to the vastness of the Wastelands and partly through the isolationist nature of Wandering culture), communities still rely on commerce to keep their ships from sinking or starving. Wanderers with no socio-political ties or affiliations tend to float their own shops and park them in these ports, earning the titles of traveling merchants. These types of ships are easier to come by, creating ports that bustle with a line of floating shops. When Wanderers are at sea, communication is not often or necessary–through these ports,exchanges of artifacts, information, and skills happen. Most notably is the exchange of cartographical information, where Wayfarers or navigators of ships fill out their ever-changing maps based on word of mouth. Ports are widespread and many, with Wanderers noting them on their maps based on their code. These codes are the numerical names for the Wandering ports, picked by its builders. Builders of ports must keep a log of every port and their assigned codes so as to not overlap names. They are built in areas where Wanderers can enter the Wastelands for a quick mission or expedition for scavenging. However, these ports come quickly as they go. There have been many times when the mists roll in thick a little sooner than expected or when the lands shift without a moment’s notice, causing Wanderers to run and pack up before they are swallowed whole. The ingenuity of the Wayfarers have created ease for builders to set up and pack up these ports at a moment's notice, with enough material on hand, though most are destroyed naturally. Not all ports are busy–some may contain just one travelling merchant.

### The Waters

Tectonic plate shifts have caused underwater caves to be filled with archives of humanity’s history. However, the radiation and capricious weather patterns have left much of the world’s waters dangerous to travel through. The waters at the edge of civilization contain disturbed species of fish, mutated and eldritch. These fish are most active in areas that contain the most pollution, described by a dark scar in the ocean with rainbow hues–oil that has spilled long ago and gathered into spots of danger. However, those brave enough to stomach these odd-looking creatures drop anchor to fish, hoping that nothing more sinister lurks in the depths.

#### _Diving Gear_

Wanderers are equipped with diving gear, often making excursions into underwater caves as much as they scour the wastelands. Each piece of gear increases survivability under the water and sometimes, in the blood-red mists.

-   Gear that helps with mobility
    -   Dive suit (also helps with temperature and defense)
    -   Fins
    -   Buoyancy Vest
-   Gear that helps with breathing
    -   Oxygen tank & regulator
    -   Diving Mask & Snorkel (also helps with visibility)

### The Ark

> “...For they took away the old planks as they decayed, putting in new and strong timber in their places, insomuch that this ship became a standing example among the philosophers, for the logical question of things that grow; one side holding that the ship remained the same, and the other contending that it was not the same.“ Plutarch, Life of Theseus 23.1

The very first ship that rescued humans from the floods. Great architects have improved its design over time, refining and reinforcing it to the large floating capitol it is today. The Ark is a large steamboat with a tall centric superstructure akin to an oil-rig. Due to its capacity to withstand the waters, other Wandering ships are also built based on its technology and design.The Ark is so large it works as its own city. Its hull is open to receiving Wanderers, often stopping at ports to help those who are lost or about to perish from the lands or the mist. Wayfarers and those with specific skills tend to set up here the most. The superstructure at its center, called its core, contains many levels and rooms, where the more permanent residents stay, such as regular Wandering citizens who utilize less active roles. Meanwhile, the deck of the Ark is reserved for activity, trades, accepting asylum-seeking Wanderers, and the rare occurrence of outside-species envoys.

The Ark’s governing authorities, and one of the only forms of government for the Wanderers, are an elusive group of council members called Maintenance. They are religious figures who maintain the history and culture of the Old World, renowned for their wisdom and knowledge, and longstanding lives. They remind the Wanderers of what was lost–what they were before, and what went wrong. They are committed to the protection and preservation of old humankind. “Call Maintenance” or “Maintenance is here” is a phrase uttered by many in times of need. They reside in the bridge, high up shrouded by the muddied clouds.

### Wandering Ships

These ships have been hardened to survive almost anything. Each ship contains cargo slots that can be used for carrying resources or equipment. If the ship gets damaged an amount larger than its hull’s hitpoints, a random cargo slot loses an item. Creative modifications to any of these ships can be made depending on the talent of its engineer such as a diving area, connected structure, etc. Equipment on the boat can upgrade up to three times max, with each upgrade increasing fishing/attack/etc by +1.

#### Class A Skiffs (dinghy)

-   Small 1-4 person boats with not much space for cargo. Quiet, relatively agile due to size, easy to build, but not much strength. Do not need engines to run, can be steered with oars.
-   Merchants sometimes build their shops on a platform floated by two dinghies and steer them/ connect them with a Class B ship. Other times merchants rely on port-stationed shops.
-   Mostly used as an emergency escape vehicle.
-   Can be equipped with a basic fishing rod and a propeller motor.
-   Cannot be upgraded into a Class B
-   Two cargo slots

#### Class B - Ships that need engines to run

-   If engines are attacked/overheated, the boat runs significantly slower and can barely be steered without an engine. Only a captain and enginemaster is needed.
-   Cabin cruiser (speed), trawler (fishing)
    -   Cabin cruisers are meant for speed and island hopping. Though not the most stable ride, its interior is comfortable for living in. Fits 12-14 people depending on upgrade.
    -   Can vary in size depending on upgrades
    -   Can be equipped with an upgradable engine
    -   Can be equipped with a basic fishing rod/s
    -   Can be equipped with weapons
    -   Can be equipped with a heat-providing light source that dissipates mist.
    -   Four cargo slots > next upgrade six (MAX)
-   Trawlers are meant for fishing. They are sturdy for long travel, but are relatively slow. Fits 6-10 people depending on upgrade.
    -   Can vary in size depending on upgrades
    -   Can be equipped with up to a basic steam engine
    -   Can be equipped with an upgradable fishing rod
    -   Can be equipped with an upgradable fishing net
    -   Can be equipped with a heat-providing light source that dissipates mist.
    -   Four cargo slots > next upgrade six > next upgrade eight (MAX)

#### Class C - Ferry, Brig

-   Both ferries and brigs carry up to 20-30 people and lots of cargo. They differ in the method of travel
-   Like skiffs, brigs do not need engines. They rely on the waves and winds and a high amount of skill to pilot. Efficient and stable
    -   Upgrades to 14 slots max, needs more crew positions. Captain, quartermaster, navigator, and 2 crew needed to pilot.
-   Ferries use engines, but use fuel more efficiently than Class B boats/have harder to damage engines. They cannot be steered without the engine, but have barebones automatic navigation technology. A captain and enginemaster is needed.
    -   Can be equipped with an upgradeable engine
    -   Upgrades to 10 slots max, more space for residential areas/rooms.
-   Both can be equipped with light source, fishing rods, weapons, and its hull can be upgraded in defense.

Class 0 - The Ark

-   Maintenance has left the details of cargo classified, but seems to carry plenty of space for resources, residents, weapons, fishing rods/nets, mist-dissipating light sources, and defense. They say that it is the gift of god that keeps on giving.

### The Mists

Though pollution has made it hard for Wanderers to survive, they have adapted well with machinery. The mists, however, are a different story.

The mist is alive, according to lucky survivors. Those first Wanderers who witnessed the emergence of the mist probably did not pay much attention to it: fog is not unusual for this polluted land. A light haze surrounded them at all times, safe enough to breathe in with simple scarves around their faces to stop the burning of their lungs. It was too late, however, when people realized that the mists they were surrounded by became thick and blood-red, contained countless eyes staring at them, and brought monsters toward their scent. Wanderers currently have developed mist-evaporating lights on their ships and respirator masks to breathe through, but a simple mistake or faulty equipment will lead them to horrors beyond their imagination.

These horrors are explained by no other than high levels of radiation, air pollution, mold, and fungi. Fog coats this mysterious outskirt region due to the amount of moisture, however through time toxic pollutants have mixed into these droplets of evaporation–spores, methane, carbon dioxide. The thick plumes wafted by the coastal winds create effects of respiration sickness, insanity that leads to paranoia, and awaken the hunger of nearby monsters.

#### Sanity

Entering or getting caught in the thick mists causes the SANITY status effect. People will gradually lose their sanity when staying within the mist at the speed of 10% per each turn at first. Certain effects happen according to sanity level and certain actions can decrease or increase sanity level. This status effect does not instantaneously disappear when you exit the affected area, however you can begin to restore sanity. A full round of rest in an unaffected area will increase sanity by 10%. Meaning, Once players witness the unleashed horrors of the ocean, they must take time to recover or find ways to speed up the process. They must also be careful to not agitate their fragile mentality.

-   Sanity Over 87%
    -   Slight color desaturation and visual distortion - decrease in agility
-   Sanity Over 35%
    -   You feel like you are being watched, you begin to see things in the mist - +5% sanity loss per each turn
    -   Moderate color desaturation and visual distortion - starting to lose abilities and skills randomly
-   Sanity Below 35%
    -   Damage threshold begins to decrease by 1 each round
    -   Monochrome vision and complete visual distortion - lose all abilities and skills
    -   More likely to be attacked by local monsters

You won’t be able to restore sanity in the mist, but plenty of Wanderers use equipment to maintain their sanity levels while embarking on excursions in these dangerous areas.

-   Wandering ships equipped with mist-dissipating devices
    -   Complete sanity stability in a radius
-   Wandering gas masks
    -   Decreases sanity loss per turn from 10% to 2-7% depending on the build quality, cost of materials, and equipment damage.
    -   Not all wanderers decide to use masks, with some relying on their keen senses and navigational expertise to detect and predict the movement of the mists.
-   Wandering diving gear with oxygen tanks
    -   Complete sanity stability until oxygen runs out

Actions that restore sanity… (outside the mists only)

-   Eating a good meal
-   Staying warm by a fire
-   Picking flowers
-   Doing Art

Actions that harm sanity…

-   Entering Combat
-   Witnessing something horrendous
-   Eating contaminated food
