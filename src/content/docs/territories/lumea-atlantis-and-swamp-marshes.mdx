With the threat of the Crystal Calamity, the world underwent a technological boom. Frontier pioneered bubble technology in hopes of kickstarting an underwater society. Despite many failed attempts across the seas, they finally were able to establish Atlantis, an underwater utopia. To their surprise, the seas were not empty.

The Aqualumeans, an intelligent underwater species, have lived beneath the surface for thousands of years, predating the Crystal Calamity, in a region of the oceans they call Lumea. As the ocean’s natural energy became increasingly imbalanced, new magical forces seeped through to the ocean floor, creating a bioelectric magic that the Aqualumeans call ‘Lux.’ Through Lux, they created a unique, sustainable environment that protected them from the violent world above.

The scientists at Frontier found a way to source the bioelectric magic of the Aqualumeans to power Atlantis, an underwater city designed to save humanity. Powered by the Aqualumean’s magic, the city and the surrounding waters are free from the pollution that plagues the surface. Encased in an air bubble dubbed the Seaglass, the city feels almost like Earth, a place to start over and forget the tragedies happening to the top-dwellers, or those who live on land. Forests and gardens grow, new children are born, and families are able to thrive.

However, Atlantis’s creation and maintenance comes at a price. Lux has helped power the city of Atlantis through a series of optic fiber cables via a partnership made with the Aqualumeans. With the combined strains of more cables shuttling Lux to fuel OmegaAI in Sylvangrove, Lux levels are dwindling down for the residents of Atlantis and the energy is starting to falter. The small but expanding magic pollution discharged from Atlantis is creating the Sludge Swamps— a muddy, poisonous area growing from the murky, almost oily secretions leaking out of the optic cables, carried by rapid currents and settling in more stagnant waters. . The Sludge Swamps have progressively been taking over the Aqualumean tribal villages, forcing many villagers to flee from the region as the pollution overtook the area. Within the Sludge Swamps are the Murk-Dwellers—Aqualumeans unable to escape or unfortunate enough to wander into the pollution’s proximity whose magic and bodies have been corrupted. They are angry, unreasonable beings that attack both humans and Aqualumeans alike. The Aqualumeans believe that saving Murk-Dwellers is possible only through taking them to the hidden reservoir of Aqualumean Lux, where their corruption can be healed. However, this process is dangerous, as healthy Aqualumeans who enter the Sludge Swamps risk being infected themselves. Even if this daunting mission were to be completed, the human pollution from the Sludge Swamps leave the former Murk-Dwellers crippled with chronic health problems and a shortened life expectancy.

This problem leaves some Aqualumeans desperate to find a way to utilize the medical technology of Atlantis, as it is the only way to save the Murk-Dwellers—their former family and friends—from the damage caused by the pollution. Meanwhile, the scientists at Frontier continue to search for the hidden Aqualumean reservoir, whose location is said to be kept a secret by the elder Aqualumeans within the tribes. Finding a new source of Lux may be the only way to continuously power Frontier’s existing processes and maintain their survival—even at the cost of the Aqualumeans’ lives.

## Atlantis: The Human City

<p style="text-align: center;"><small>_A look inside Atlantis City_</small></p>

Atlantis was founded by a science division of Frontier, who established a one time lottery system to determine who would be invited to contribute to the birth of the city, advertising it as a haven in anticipation of the Crystal Calamity. Once the city was established, those that failed to qualify for habitation in Atlantis were left to succumb to the land’s ruin, and thus began the last community of “pure” humans. Nobody new is allowed into Atlantis and nobody gets out either—why would you want to leave such a perfectly designed society?

Atlantis is an artificially engineered underwater ecotopia city where the surviving human race lives, encapsulated by an air bubble. This air bubble is known as the Seaglass, named for its ability to display the beauty of the ocean from a distance, though it is a traversable surface. The Seaglass is the successful product of many failed attempts at bubble technology. It is transparent for those inside the city, but when viewed from the outside, it mirrors the ocean and conceals Atlantis from view. This keeps the city hidden from potential threats while also supporting the founding scientist’s carefully crafted image that Atlantis exists in perfect harmony with the ocean around it. The Seaglass serves an additional purpose as an atmospheric regulator intended to simulate a mild, temperate climate all year round. It also acts as a daily illusion of the sky, amplifying the sunlight that filters through the ocean to follow the patterns of the sun, moon, and stars.

The Seaglass and the rest of the city is powered by an Aqualumean Lux core that sits in the heart of the city, provided early in its establishment. Though it powers every system and structure, its gradual depletion is a tightly guarded secret, and has only manifested in brief energy shortages in city power, which citizens are told to dismiss as caused by irrelevant attacks from external forces. Humans are able to live as they would on land but free of pollution and trouble inside Atlantis. They are able to explore outside the city, but they require full masks called ExoMasks that provide lightweight protection and access to oxygen. These ExoMasks are hard to make, as Arborian oxygen capsules are needed for production.

Inside Atlantis, the city is organized into districts that serve specific functions to support the city. The agricultural district is one of the principal districts, marked by its multi-tiered indoor farms and ability to produce a variety of crops and animals. Homes additionally have the ability to grow vegetables and fruits and are thus able to sustain themselves. The city’s water source is drawn from the ocean, the water desalinated and recycled to maintain clean water use and provide irrigation for the farms. Grass has been exchanged for sand and native marine biodiversity has been engineered to survive in the open air within the Seaglass. The architectures mimic water flow, with bioluminescence ingrained into the walls of most buildings. Courtyards were placed throughout the city to encourage communal gatherings and residential buildings were designed to emphasize open space with many windows and doors. These were built with sustainable materials to be responsive to the residents’ individual needs.

Transportation is efficient, silent, and eco-friendly in Atlantis. The city primarily operates on a magnetic train system powered by the Lux core within its 2.5 mile diameter to connect further distances and E-cars have been established as an individual mode of transportation. The train and all other transportation has been engineered to maximize its efficiency while minimizing the core’s energy use.

## Lumea: The Underwater World

To the Aqualumeans, the entirety of the underwater realm is known as Lumea. However, in reality, their population only consists of a small portion of the vast oceans. The Aqualumeans live in 4 tribes tucked in vast kelp forests, within distance of each other. This has allowed Aqualumeans to build deep relationships with each other over time and share resources as well as defenses. Aqualumeans have the ability to mentally project their voice to one another, making them especially skilled in coordinating tasks that require skill in silence, such as fishing or spying.

The Aqualumeans rely on Lux to nourish their people and land, which is a magic- and life-giving energy that is sourced from the Lux reservoir. The location of this reservoir is a secret guarded by the ruling chiefs of the tribes, who are known as the Celestial Dragons. These Celestial Dragons are the oldest beings in Lumea, having said to have drawn their power from the creation of the Lux reservoir, and thus have a deep connection with Lux. The Aqualumeans choose to draw from the ocean’s natural formations to shape their homes. Coral alcoves and anemone beds form the foundation of their architecture, providing shelter and unique lighting that varies with the ocean's natural cycles. Schools of vibrant fish and bioluminescent creatures swim freely through their living spaces.

However, because Lumea has been encroached upon by the humans, the region has been thrown into a disarray. The humans’ misuse of the Lux core has disrupted the flow of energy, gradually emitting murky pollution. This, combined with certain agricultural chemicals and pollution swirling down-current of the oceans from Grønn Verden, has greatly affected the reefs and vegetation around Lumea. The oceans have become more acidic and harder for marine organisms and Aqualumeans to live in. Coral has begun turning white and crumbling at the slightest touch, bleached and dead. As Lux is being disproportionately drained by supporting Atlantis and Sylvangrove, once-thriving regions are rapidly succumbing to the Sludge Swamps, a creeping area of dead and decaying marine life that spreads slowly but steadily into Aqualumean territory. The Aqualumean villages closest to the pollution have become the center of the infected region. Those who were able to escape fled to the nearest villages while those infected remained in the Sludge Swamps, shells of their former communities and selves. The impacts of the Sludge Swamps influence the surrounding Lumean waters and Atlantis, making it more murky with the dead debris floating around. This has caused Atlantis’s once perfect and camouflaged outer shell to become more apparent to outsiders.

## The Sludge Swamps

Like other areas of the world, the pollution’s corruption of the sea has led to the creation of destructive sea mutants. Until recently, this phenomenon has not affected the Aqualumeans, but the pollution has now created the Sludge Swamps, an ever-expanding ever-expanding inhabitable part of Lumea.It is full of chemical pollution and waste, and has negative health consequences for anyone who enters it. Villages have had to evacuate to escape the oncoming Sludge Swamp. This region is full of pollution, black oil stains covering the Aqualumean architecture and coral reefs, which have now mutated to be larger in size, and have a foul smell due to decay. Murk Dwellers are the corrupted Aqualumean population that live in the Sludge Swamps— as a result of being exposed to pollution, they have become violent and angry. They survive by scavenging dead animals who have been affected by the pollution and ocean acidification. The Murk Dwellers submit to the law of survival of the fittest—though they have no organized form of community, they recognize the power of Murk Dwellers stronger than them. The more stable areas of the Sludge Swamps belong to the strongest. Unless provoked, most of the Murk Dwellers keep within their territories. But with the growing accumulation of the Sludge Swamps and better vision of the city of Atlantis through the Seaglass, they stand a chance at taking over Lumea, and potentially all of the oceans altogether.
