In a world reshaped by cataclysm and corruption, survival is no longer about who holds the most power, but who can navigate the volatile skies and shifting tides of the Aeolian Archipelago. What remains of civilization clings to the mountaintops of a drowned Earth, where ancient technology collides with newfound arcane forces, and the balance between nature and industry teeters on a knife's edge. This is the fractured world born of the Crystal Calamity, where storms rule, corporations exploit, and rebels take to the wind in search of freedom, purpose, or revenge.

## The Archipelago

Years ago, billions perished during the Crystal Calamity. As the oceans continued to rise rapidly, only those who retreated to the highest mountaintops survived. This newly-flooded planet Earth gave rise to an entirely new geography, forming the Aeolian Archipelago. Weather is fractured, with pockets of temperate weather punctuated with slashes of angry storms and rocky seas. While rarely recognized as such anymore, the islands that make up the archipelago are metal-rich mountaintops.

The Crystal Calamity, however, brought more than just topographical changes. At the onset of this world-changing disaster, the imbalance of the oceans’s natural energy also gave rise to new arcane forces. From the start of the chaos and destruction emerged Veltharion the Tidebinder, the first recorded Skycaller. Now hailed as a legendary sage, Veltharion is said to have performed irreplicable divine feats of water and weather manipulation, saving thousands of lives over the course of the floods before she disappeared. By parting walls of water and calming the raging storms, she provided people additional time to escape and inspired hundreds of magic users. While accounts are mixed on how Veltharion’s magic came to scatter and why the legendary figure vanished, more and more skycallers have been gradually discovered, all with a heightened connection to the environment.

New power is never met without resistance, and the existence of skycallers is no exception. Particularly interested in these powerful casters are the leaders of Fair Labs Organization of Nanotechnology (FLOoN), a smaller branch of Frontier that has come to control almost every aspect of life on the archipelago. Since the infrastructure of the old world was generally not housed at high elevations, almost all technology was lost to the Crystal Calamity, leaving society to start over. The only notable exception was FLOoN’s mountaintop compound, housing advanced old-world nanotechnology. FLOoN has since expanded their technological heights, including the use of metallurgy, or the extraction and processing of the rich metals found in the mines of the Isle of Omphalos, FLOoN’s base of operations. Metallurgy releases incredible amounts of pollution, due to the strenuous process of fusing metals and nanotechnology, thus it is the root cause of many struggles faced by the archipelago’s residents.

Because of the massive amounts of air pollutants generated by FLOoN’s operations, the environment of the Aeolian Archipelago is characterized by storms, making sky calling a highly coveted talent. Thunderstorms are very common in certain areas, intensified by a haze of factory smoke, where the sun only shines for a few weeks out of the year. Clouds are omnipresent even when the sun is visible, and the constant high winds have defined much of the archipelago’s cultural practices. The wind always blows at ground level, with the speeds growing faster as they move further from the Isle of Omphalos. At higher altitudes, the wind is even more vicious and generally moves in a clockwise fashion. Some local communities, referred to as Cloudrunners, have been able to harness this wind pattern to travel across islands. In contrast, there are patches of the archipelago that experience sunny, even peaceful weather. Some of these places gained naturally temperate weather after the fracturing of the skies, such as the tropical breezes that run through Beach Island. Other places, like the Fields of Asphodel, are kept in perpetual bliss through the omnipresent Skycallers that station and rotate day and night. All throughout the archipelago are the native Avenari, a native species of bird-human hybrids that soar through the skies and the waters. However, the exponential increase in pollution and constant Skycaller manipulation of the weather threatens the fragile archipelago even further, one that may split the skies apart…

FLOoN’s pollution has not just affected the skies, but also the sea. The currents of the seas push pollution to the outskirts of the archipelago, choking The Thousand Isles and the Dead Zone. The tumultuous rains and winds have leached metallic and industrial runoff into the seas, springs, and groundwater basins, the people’s main source of freshwater. Both FLOoN and the people thus rely on Skycallers to direct rain their way to slowly fill their rain barrels whenever they need freshwater. Because of this, most residents avoid producing pollutants at all costs, sticking to natural materials only. Most available infrastructure and tools are made from relatively primitive yet renewable materials such as wood, branches, and leaves, with stone being used as heavy anchoring points to prevent things from being swept away.

FLOoN continues to manufacture metallurgical products and ship them out to other branches of Frontier, industrial waste and all, despite having the resources and technology to develop more eco-friendly metallurgical products. But if the pollution doesn’t affect the top brass at HQ, they won’t spare resources to combat it.

The metallurgical processes adopted by FLOoN produce copious amounts of fossil fuels that exacerbates the pollution and haze. In addition, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides from the fumes react in the atmosphere, creating acid rain in various islands. This creates great harm to the people of the archipelago by increasing respiratory issues and harm to plants and forests in the surrounding regions. The Ivory Peaks are especially vulnerable to acid rain bouts due to their high altitudes. Coupled with the high wind speeds, it can cause acid monsoons, one of the deadliest phenomenons on the archipelago.

## FLOoN

FLOoN started as a medical nanorobotics company in the old world, working to cure the sick and help the population. They were conveniently acquired by Frontier shortly before sea levels began to rise. For better or for worse, the Crystal Calamity left them as the only remaining owners of this advanced technology. Thrown into an unexpected position of power, the company pivoted to other uses for nanotechnology, such as consumer goods and military devices for Frontier (or any others who could afford it) using the rich metals below their feet, and quickly fulfilled their inevitable role as a metallurgy monopoly, among controlling many of the other systems in the world.

FLOoN is known for crushing rebellions and using its vast resources to maintain control, even as its technology pollutes the environment. The production of metallurgical materials relies on carbon-heavy methods, creating significant emissions.

FLOoN is led by a council of advisors, each overseeing a division of the archipelago. Beneath them are workers striving for a better life, unknowingly fueling a system that exploits others and harms the outside world. This ignorance stems from downstream effects of the Myth of Tenure, part of Frontier’s corporate culture that holds undoubted loyalty and reward synonymous with one another. FLOoN citizens are taught to fear outsiders, but the real destruction comes from within. To most, FLOoN seems like a utopia, but it is built on secrecy and control. While some live in ignorance, others live in fear. Many try to escape, often unsuccessfully.

## The Cloudrunners

Cloudrunners are criminals, looking to poke at the beast that is FLOoN…perhaps by overturning vulnerable metallurgical cargo ships leaving the Isle of Omphalos from time to time. Although some may have noble intentions or lofty goals, the life of a Cloudrunner is characterized by violent conflict, constant danger, and a struggle for survival. Most law-abiding citizens try to keep their head down and avoid Cloudrunners at all costs, lest they become collateral damage in their mischief. Enterprising local businesses may enlist the help of Cloudrunners for a variety of reasons—bodyguards/protection, disrupting corporate actions, smuggling money or goods, or any activities that they might want to keep hidden from the corporation. These contracts are the main source of income for most Cloudrunners, highly prized and contested among rival Cloudrunner “cells” (factions). Reputation is everything, and the “rules” of Cloudrunner society are mostly self-enforcing. Nobody wants to hire someone who has sold out their contractor to the corporation, gone back on their promises, or repeatedly failed to complete their tasks, and so less reliable Cloudrunners tend to be kicked out of groups and are left behind. Likewise, contractors rarely dare to deal in bad faith with Cloudrunners because they know that they could just as easily be their next target.

Cloudrunner is a job title more than anything. Etiquette and ground rules will vary from cell to cell, but generally leaders expect dependability, respect, and effectiveness from members. Mistakes are tolerated but heavily punished, although most Cloudrunner mistakes by themselves often result in a lengthy prison sentence or death. Cloudrunners live life on the edge, and as such they live extremely fast. None of them expect to make it to old age, so every decision is fueled off adrenaline, dopamine, and a fight to see the next morning. Cloudrunners are made up of all species and genders, although birds tend to understand flying a bit better than everyone else. As long as they can keep up, anyone can be a Cloudrunner. People typically join cells either by being recruited or breaking the law and catching the attention of veterans. For some, being a Cloudrunner is a way to provide money for their family, even if they can’t be around them. For others, their cell is their family because they have nobody else. Some join to fight back against the FLOoN ideologically or settle a personal vendetta. Others are in it just for the thrill, although they usually tend to burn out quickly. Whatever their reasons, Cloudrunners are a wind-hardened bunch of criminals, stopping at nothing to achieve their goals.

The reason Cloudrunners are sought after (and how they got their name) beyond just hired protection is their willingness to travel the skies. “cloudrunning” refers to the act of strapping on a glider, jumping off a cliff or high building, and riding the winds to wherever they desire. The basic wind patterns and bad weather patches have been ingrained in each Cloudrunner, but certain jump points for each cell are closely guarded secrets, with each having preferred spots on each island.

Using these gliders is incredibly dangerous, requiring intense concentration throughout the entire flight: one wrong move or slow reaction to a gust of wind means certain death. Because of this danger, the corporation does not attempt to control the skies, allowing Cloudrunners free reign, but does monitor them to the best of their (limited) abilities. Cloudrunner missions are often characterized by stealth, planning, and subterfuge. Given the inherent danger of Cloudrunner activities even without overt combat, pains are usually taken to avoid outright conflict: sneaking onto ships, avoiding guards, smuggling goods, and flying under the radar (literally).

## The Skycallers

Simultaneously dangerous and endangered, Skycallers are the most valuable people in the Aeolian Archipelago. Widely feared for their supernatural control over the weather, Skycallers are rare beings that can leverage their powers in a number of ways, but often face incredible danger and strife. Their ability to control the weather and wind comes from a physical connection to their environment, but this also causes severe health effects, both mental and physical, when around severe pollution. In particular, acid rain is one of the skycaller’s biggest weaknesses, and their power weakens whenever they are caught in these unique storms. The constant manipulation of the natural climate by the Skycallers has exacerbated weather even more, causing even rougher storms and tumultuous tsunamis. Public opinion also varies, but one thing is certain: very few people trust Skycallers. Some revere them like gods, some are wary of the power they wield, some believe they’re only good for intensifying the wrath of the corporation onto their little island, and others look down on their power as an abhorrent mutation. A Skycaller’s power can be wielded to great effect against most people, but those that flaunt it often end up dead by the hands of the corporation due to their carelessness.

The majority of Skycallers end up joining Cloudrunner cells. While any fool can strap on a glider and jump off a cliff, praying to whatever gods they hold dear, veteran Cloudrunners know that having a skycaller on their side is key to reliably navigating the skies. Flying becomes vastly easier when you have someone with you who can stop the worst gusts or storms and provide steady wind towards your destination. For this reason, nearly all Cloudrunner cells have a Skycaller among them, even if their exact identity is unknown to most of the members. The existence of a Skycaller is a threat - not just the power itself but a reminder that the corporation is almost certainly right on their heels as well. FLOoN is known to tirelessly hunt down any report of a Skycaller by monitoring abrupt weather changes, seeking to either hire them or kill them if they refuse. It’s rumored that the corporation themselves have Skycallers that rank very highly, known as Stormreavers, but the exact number is unknown. Generally speaking, estimates stay in the single digits. None have been directly sighted, but strange storm behavior has been noticed around the occasional dreadnought (FLOoN’s ships), and survivors of Cloudrunner cells that have been obliterated by the corporation have reported localized storms appearing in their escape path. Rumors suggest that the Skyreavers also contribute to the metallurgy process, using their powers to control the winds and storms in places of metal extraction. While all captured Skycallers are given the option to join the Stormreavers, most refuse to work with FLOoN because of their allegiance to the archipelago. Those that do are viewed as traitors, but they are greatly rewarded with nanotechnology enhancements that help mitigate the negative effects of pollution to their health, as well as a boost in salary.

    <small>_A map of the islands within the Aeolian Archipelago_</small>
</p>

### Center - Isle of Omphalos

Located in the center of the Aeolian Archipelago, the Isle of Omphalos is a symbol of FLOoN’s control of the island and is home to its central headquarters. On its southern end, The Isle of Omphalos comprises the densest jungle in all of the Archipelago, the Tangle of Delphi, where scarcely any light pierces through the thick canopy. Hidden deep within the depths of the jungle is rumored to lie FLOoN Lagoon, a secret bastion of peace within the unforgiving jungle. On the northern end of the island, the jungle breaks into a magnificent clearing, a beautiful open field called Horizon’s Edge which FLOoN has converted into its base of operations within the Aeolian Archipelago, overlooking the entire archipelago from the peak of its steep cliffs. Mines dot the entire isle, full of robotic drills that plunge deep through the ground and excavate precious metals for production. Being FLOoN’s headquarters, the entire island is crawling with corporate soldiers, meaning only the most daring Cloudrunner would consider stepping foot on the island unprepared.

### Northwest Quadrant - Tundra Isles

The Tundra Isles house three diverse islands in a triangular formation within its frigid waters, the busiest of which is the Northern Trading Hub, a bustling port facilitating trade throughout all the Aeolian Archipelago. Perpetually busy, the Northern Trading Hub seems to never rest, with the businesses of the port crowding the tiny island. The Fields of Asphodel provide a stark contrast just one island over, with unassuming houses, idyllic cottages along its shore, surrounding its famed concentric flower fields. Colorful flowers appear in concentric rings along the island, with the innermost roses fetching their weight in gold. There are stationed Skycallers at all hours here, ensuring the weather stays temperate.Towering over both islands are the Ivory Peaks, whose harsh tundra and acid rain climate makes scaling its peaks the ultimate challenge for mountain climbers and explorers. This area is home to the tallest mountain in the region, Mount Neverest, and legends say scaling the mountain will yield a reward much better than bragging rights.

### Southwest Quadrant - Beach Island

The Beach Island is situated in a rare, lush spot of the archipelago, housing a thriving community in warm, tropical waters. It is settled by two major towns which anchor the local economy: Ironwood, nestled in the jungles of the island, which thrives on hard labor from logging and mining operations; and Wavecrest, located on the coast of the island, which relies on fishing, agriculture, and fine craftsmanship. While the two settlements have vastly different environments, they are deeply interconnected with each other through a well-traveled trade route known as the Banana Trail. While the Beach Island has prospered for generations since the Crystal Calamity, its population has recently saturated, inadvertently causing a crisis of resource overuse which is leading to an imbalance in air quality and water levels. If change is not brought about quickly, the fragile equilibrium of the Beach Island will surely be thrown into turmoil.

### Southeast Quadrant - The Thousand Isles

The Thousand Isles is named for the countless number of tiny islands in close proximity to each other, unlike anywhere else in the Aeolian Archipelago. The Thousand Isles is home to the Southern Trading Hub, a bustling hub of business and commerce, in spite of its smaller size compared to its counterpart in the Tundra Isles. FLOoN has a strong presence in this region, with one of their largest ports called the Shipping Center acting as an outpost of operations within the Thousand Isles. The islands of the Thousand Isles lie in shallow water, prohibiting its interior from being navigated by large ships.

### Northeast Quadrant - Dead Zone

The Dead Zone, formerly known as Eros Island, was once home to a thriving Cloudrunner community in its titular Port Eros, before shifting regional climates enveloped the island in a dense, impenetrable fog. Eros Island was quickly abandoned as the fog made the island and its black sand shores far too dangerous to navigate, and today, only the most brash Cloudrunners can gaze upon its crumbling ruins. The Dead Zone is primarily a saltwater marsh island, and was previously known for the rare and exotic herbs that grew in the Tharun Swamps. This all changed after the Crystal Calamity as the agricultural runoffs from Grønn Verden travelled along ocean currents to the Aeolian Archipelago, and specifically the Dead Zone. These excess nutrients caused eutrophication and the death of plants and marine-life alike. Live organisms are hard to find in this region. The rare few Cloudrunners that return from expeditions to the Dead Zone have reported that the swamps have fallen eerily silent since the fog descended. At the center of the Dead Zone lies Mount Eros, a tall, rocky spire which just barely pokes out of the fog layer. While most Cloudrunners will tell you that even approaching the Dead Zone is suicide, something hidden deep within Eros Island may be well worth the risk.

## Travel

Stormy seas, rising waters, and unpredictable weather dominate the region, all worsened by the corporation's relentless pollution. FLOoN’s massive armored dreadnoughts are the only ships capable of reliably navigating these conditions. Built from reinforced metal to withstand hurricane winds, debris-filled waters, and corrosive salt air, these industrial vessels emit even more pollutants into already dying oceans. The rising toxicity has put immense pressures on fish populations and have left coastal communities struggling to survive.

For everyday travel, the corporation offers slow, heavily guarded public transport between islands via smaller ships. However, natives of the outer islands take a different approach. Conscious of the environmental toll, they rely on small, climate-friendly sailboats crafted from sustainable materials like bamboo or reclaimed wood. These boats are delicate and can’t handle open-ocean storms or the floating debris churned up by corporate activities, effectively trapping many communities within their islands. Any hopes of escaping the islands for a better place to live or to escape FLOoN’s grasp are slim to none.

Cloudrunners have found freedom in the skies, using gliders to escape the chaos below. While designs vary, most gliders follow the same structure: a lightweight wooden frame, one large wing in front, a smaller one in the back, and simple hand-and-foot controls. They carry only one person, strapped to the frame, and require skill to avoid the unpredictable winds and violent weather shaped by corporate activity.

## Equipment

Weapons are primarily crafted from hardened wood and stone, reflecting the limited resources available to most outside FLOoN. Metal weapons, while more effective, are prohibitively expensive and difficult to produce. Modern weaponry—such as guns, laser weapons, and nanotech devices—do exist, but it is exclusively manufactured and tightly controlled by the corporation. Some of these advanced weapons have been stolen by Cloudrunners.

Using weapons, particularly laser-based technology, often triggers immediate and disastrous environmental reactions, such as toxic fallout or sudden storms. These risks, coupled with the scarcity of such items, make their use rare. The corporation itself prefers natural or low-tech weapons when practical, both to minimize environmental backlash and to maintain long-term control over their more advanced tools. However, when pressed, they are not above deploying their deadliest options, especially when operating from the relative safety of their fortified islands or heavily armored dreadnoughts. Anything that will create great environmental destruction, from colossal ships and weaponry, must be built to withstand the very consequences they exacerbate. This often means building with reinforced metals and other durable materials, further increasing the resource disparity between the corporation and the rest of the world. The result is a clear divideas the corporation’s industrial dominance continues to persist in a never ending cycle.
