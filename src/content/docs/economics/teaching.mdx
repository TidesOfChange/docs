## Tides of Change is much more than a gameâ€”it is a powerful learning device.

Through immersive story-based gameplay, students work through real-world dynamics of labor inequality, corporate monopoly, resource scarcity, and alternative economic systems. Each scenario is designed to provoke reflection, including how power is structured, how decisions are motivated, and what it means to survive or resist in an unjust system.

Whether grappling with the power of a megacorporation, stratified social classes, or stateless cooperation zones, players are continually faced with ethical choices that demand attention and can carry lasting consequences.

## The game empowers students to:

-   Recognize corporate power and economic control
-   Reflect on social class, inequality, and labor
-   Engage with market forces like supply, demand
-   Envision alternative systems through stateless and communal societies

Tides of Change is ideal for high school and college classrooms and allows students to turn economic theory into lived experience, demanding that individuals think deeply, question critically, and act deliberately.
