## Overview of Communism and Stateless Societies

In Tides of Change , this system shows what a world might look like without governments, money, or private property. Instead of relying on authority or profit, people live in small communities that share resources and make decisions together. These are known as stateless societies that are influenced by communist ideas, where no one owns more than anyone else and everyone contributes based on their abilities.

## Examples from the Game World:

-   The Verdant Reachees
-   The Fractured Steppes
-   The Ember Freeholds

There are also no banks, corporations, or police forces in these regions. Instead they have reputation, accountability, and shared survival to keep things running smoothly.

## Real World Connections

This world gets inspiration from real life communities and ideas like the Zapatistas in Mexico, where their town runs without relying on the national government. These societies usually form in resistance to exploitation and try to build more equal, sustainable alternatives.

##How Players Can Experience This System
When players enter these zones they will be challenged to adapt to a society that values cooperation over individual gain, earn trust and responsibility instead of money or status, and decide whether they will respect the local traditions or disrupt them for their own survival. Players can be asked to join farming rotations, share tools, or speak in local assemblies. Refusing to contribute could lead to exile, while full participation on the other hand could unlock community based support and collective power

## Why It Matters

These regions ask big questions about freedom, equality, and survival.They give a contrast to capitalist or corporate areas in the game and challenge players to think about what kind of society they want.

## Connecting to the Larger System

While Frontier dominates a lot of Tides of Change through corporate control and vertical integration, similar to Amazon in our world, the stateless societies like the Ember Freeholds and Verdant Reaches represent an alternative path. These regions reject centralized power and formal markets altogether. Instead they work more like real world informal economies that are seen in disaster zones or autonomous regions, where survival depends on mutual aid and resource sharing. By contrasting with Frontierâ€™s control, these zones challenge players to think critically about systems of dependence, resistance, and what a post capitalist future could look like.
