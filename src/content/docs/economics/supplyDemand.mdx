## Frontier’s Role and Overview of Supply and Demand

In Tides of Change, the economy is run by one company called Frontier. They may be a large mega corporation, but many people need them to survive. Frontier not only provides jobs for people, but housing and food for employees. Citizens have the choice of looking for work elsewhere instead of supporting Frontier, but that would mean living a harder life where their food and housing may be harder to get. This way of living would most likely only work for a small portion of the population. 

## Examples from the Game World

- Since Frontier controls the market for most items, they choose the prices. However, they cannot price gauge or other smaller businesses would get a chance to dominate the market
- Those that run frontier most likely try to price their products at an equilibrium price
- Frontier supplies almost all products and has enough budget to create new ones when needed, so when citizens demand a new product they can supply it.

## Real World Connections

In our world, the closest thing to Frontier would most likely be Amazon. Amazon has not nearly monopolized every market, but they have dominated many spaces in e-commerce and have even spread to food as well. We do not yet have a mega-corporation that rents houses, nor does most of the population work for them. Amazon’s prices are constantly fluctuating due to supply and demand. 

## How Players Will Experience this System

When players play tides of change, they will inevitably encounter the need to buy items whether that’s food, water, shelter, or other items that may be useful. These items may fluctuate in price due to scarcity, and people’s desire to own the product. They may also have to bargain and set prices in a theoretical second hand market. Players will also have to decide whether they want to support Frontier and work for them, or try to find a way to make a living elsewhere. 

## Why it Matters

Players will have the dilemma of choosing where to work and where to buy from like the real world. They will have to learn how to deal in a society where prices change based on how they do in real life, which could help players learn about supply and demand.
