In the aftermath of climate ruin, society breakdown, and resource depletion, Tides of Change offers players a distinct role-playing experience—one that does not merely involve character stats or quests, but the reconstruction of whole systems of sustenance and society. Instead of conventional fantasy or science fiction RPGs, Tides of Change concentrates on economics, work, and power in game play. Whether players are figuring out how to barter for clean water, opting in and out of monopolistic pressures, or negotiating the flows of refugees and labor hierarchies, the game is constantly asking: How do societies organize themselves when the world as we know it no longer does?

This project was conceived from that question. As students of economics and systems thinking, we were struck by how vividly the economic story is told in Tides of Change even where it isn't explicitly said. We could trace how deeply the economic thought pervades the world-building: who has control over food, who gets to make the rules, who gets left behind.

Our intention was to pull those threads out and link them up with real-world economic systems—some of which are already taut with the impacts of climate crisis, inequality, and privatization.

We recognized five fundamental economic systems within the game economy that reflect those of the actual economy: Corporate monopolies, Supply and demand under scarcity, Stateless communal economies, Labor hierarchy and exploitation, and Opportunity cost and circular flow.

Every member of the class selected one system to investigate, analyzing both game representation and its real-world equivalent. The outcome is a collection of multi-part analyses that integrate theory and interactive fiction. Frontier Corporation's monopoly in Tides is matched by Amazon's vertical integration, and the trading between isolated settlements mirrors what economists refer to as "informal economies," which occur in actual disaster zones and refugee camps.
