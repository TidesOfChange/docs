## Overview of Opportunity Cost and Circular Flow

In Tides of Change, players can choose to spend their currency on a wide variety of upgrades, from improved armor and resources to different magical and physical abilities. Most of the purchasable upgrades are manufactured by the main monopolistic entity on the game, Frontier, illustrating the circular nature of currency exchange from player to corporation (manufacturer) and vice versa. Similarly, when characters start out in the game, they are allowed to select three pieces of unique gear specific to their backgrounds, forcing players to weigh the costs and benefits of each item to maximize their statistics. Opportunity cost is a concept that is applied to nearly every decision made in both Tides of Change and in real life – leading to a tangible example of how a singular choice can lead to cascading consequences. 

## Examples from the Game World:
- Frontier Magitech Gear 
- Equipment Selection 
- The Working Class

## Real World Connections / How Players Experience This System

As previously mentioned, Frontier exists as a near-omnipotent monopoly within Tides of Change– meaning that within the circular flow diagram, it occupies every position within the market other than the households and individual consumers, from supplier to manufacturer to retailer. This centralized dominance highlights the systemic challenges in the way of dismantling monopolistic entities and fostering a more diversified, competitive market. Without significant external intervention—which would ideally be strict federal regulation in real-world economic systems—efforts to introduce market plurality or consumer choice remain largely ineffective. Frontier’s existence within Tides of Change serves as a compelling allegory for the stagnation in a monopolistic society and the critical role of institutional oversight in ensuring economic balance and equity.

## Why It Matters

Not only do these concepts highlight the importance of making insightful, weighted decisions, but also how difficult it really is to make a choice without the substantial influence of the society and systems an individual exists in.
