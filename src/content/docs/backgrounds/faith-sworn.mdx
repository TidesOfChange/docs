title: Faith Sworn
description: Faith Sworn Background
---

The faith sworn is primarily interested in maintaining symbols of culture and faith. Where all is lost, hope remains–these individuals cultivate that hope and use it to organize and mobilize others. Faith Sworn will swear an oath toward a person, place, item, or group and gain the strength of devotion in return. Many Faith Sworn exist among Wanderers, tending to localize in one spot and focus their efforts in guiding and teaching others or organizing individuals for a specific cause. These individuals are very localized and seldom travel – much like The Ark’s Archivist, whose oath is to gather any and all artifacts of the Old Earth to rescue the histories of those left behind and scribe the stories of those still alive to impart hope and purpose. Faith Sworn act as guardians to their cause, steeled by knowledge and their own bodies.
