Your character has not sprung out of a void. It is assumed that they have had a bit of a life prior to the adventures that lay before them now. This life will have included experience and training in a specific background, and will grant your player access to unique skills and expertises. 

Backgrounds stem from specific territories where those expertises are prized and exceptionally useful. While background flavor-text may reference a specific area, any background can find use and value in any territory. 

Each background provides players with 5 relevant skills that begin “unlocked”, as well as a unique skill available only to that background that starts at a level 3. Additionally, each background has an “Expertise Tree” that offers unique things that only that background can do. The first expertise in the tree begins “unlocked”. Players can unlock additional expertises from their tree by spending experience points. 

There are many possible backgrounds a player can take to customize their character, and some are more complicated than others. While Tides of Change as a whole is pretty magic-light, a few backgrounds also offer enhanced magic capabilities. To help support players in choosing a background that will be fun for them, below is a brief synopsis of each option, grouped by their primary focus, along with a complexity rating of 1-5 (with 1 being the simplest).
