## Introduction

Welcome to the Aeolian Archipelago! This adventure takes a party of 2-5 characters on a scavenger hunt-type quest through the five main areas of the Aeolian Archipelago. Although the size of this supplement may be daunting, each area can be run as its own self-contained mini adventure, resulting in around 3-5 sessions of play. This adventure is designed for players who are just starting out with brand-new characters, but combat encounters and success thresholds may be adjusted to challenge more experienced players. For example, you can always add more Corporate Soldiers to the fight, increase the awareness of guards, or impose more environmental restrictions. Remember that as the Game Master you have the freedom to tweak this supplement to make the most fun for your group!

## Setup And Adventure Summary

How did the party get here? Are they all natives to the archipelago, have they come to see the sights, are they lured by promises of adventure and power? However they arrived, they should find themselves on Beach Island - a crescent-shaped safe haven for locals and tourists alike. The local legend is that Veltharion - the original and most powerful Skycaller, an order of people with the ability to control the wind and the waves - has hidden a trail of clues throughout the isles, waiting for those brave and strong enough to follow them. Viewing the inscription at the Crystal Mound sets the party off on a quest to gather the clues on each of the other regions of the archipelago - the Thousand Isles, Tundra Isles, and Dead Zone - before heading to the central Isle of Omphalos to meet Veltharion herself. Nobody has been able to complete this quest yet, not even the monopolistic megacorporation Fair Labs Organization of Nanotechnology (FLOoN) that rules the archipelago. Perhaps your group of adventurers can be the first?

## The Adventure Begins: Beach Island

![Map of Beach Island](../../../assets/archipelago/beach.png)

The Beach Island, with its striking crescent shape, thrives in warm tropical waters and is driven by a self-sustaining balance of trade and necessity. A variety of terrain and agriculture populate the island – lush forests on the west, vibrant crops like dragonfruit and mango toward the center, and palm trees with sandy beaches on the east. Two towns anchor the island’s economy: Ironwood, nestled near the jungle, is a hub of hard labor, focusing on logging and mining. Wavecrest, located along the coastline, thrives on food production, fishing, and fine craftsmanship. While the towns are vastly different in atmosphere and purpose, they’re deeply interconnected, relying on a well-traveled trade route to exchange resources.
As the population of Beach Island saturated, its resources began facing potential overuse. Wood is being consumed faster than it can regrow, and fish have become both scarce and disease-ridden. Whirlpools to the south, east of the island, have stirred unnaturally large and aggressive storms, while rising tides bring in waves of trash and pollution from FLOoN Isle. Island tensions have naturally risen, prompting many adventurers to leave in search of answers to this changing atmosphere. Veltharion may have created this safe haven against the great floods, but it will soon be lost if nothing changes.
As you step onto the sandy beach, the salty tang of the sea greets you, carried by a light breeze. Gulls squawk overhead, circling in search of scraps, while the occasional crab scuttles quickly back to its burrow. 
Off in the distance, thin trails of smoke rise above the treetops, marking the heart of the town. Nearby, traders push carts piled high with goods, their footsteps crunching against the sand as they make their way towards their destination. As you follow along, the smell of fresh-cut lumber grows stronger, accompanied by the steady clink of pickaxes.

## Start

The players gather at a bustling tavern in Ironwood, a popular stop for adventurers looking to make a name for themselves. As they chat and sip their drinks, they overhear a group of locals discussing a tragic event: a party of travelers recently perished while attempting to follow Veltharion's quest. Since the Great Floods, Veltharion has vanished – yet she has left behind strange inscriptions near the Crystal Mound. Rumors claim the legendary skycaller has left behind immense ancient power, lost knowledge, or possibly still walks among the storms. The shop owner, Edward Earl, listens intently from behind the counter, his life full of wisdom and experience. His eyes gleam with curiosity, as if he has details he’s waiting to spill.


## Ironwood
At the heart of Ironwood stands a massive sawmill, where the island's vast yet dwindling forest is harvested. The sawmill is the town's lifeblood, but the trees that once seemed endless are now in short supply. The people of Ironwood are hardworking and reserved, focused on their labor but always willing to lend a hand when needed. Despite the constant buzz of activity, there's a sense of unease about the future, as resources are being consumed faster than they can regenerate.

### Sawmill Tavern
Owned by the head of the sawmill, this rustic establishment doubles as a community gathering spot and a makeshift inn for travelers. A secret trapdoor behind the bar leads to an underground fighting ring, where wagers are placed on brawlers from all over. The tavern is a perfect place to hear rumors, secure a room, or get drawn into the underground fights
NPC: Edward Earl, the friendly and outgoing sawmill owner, is the heart of Ironwood. Despite his friendliness, he has worked at the sawmill his entire life, and his fitness has helped him age surprisingly well. With a loud laugh and a talent for telling stories, Edward quickly warms to adventurers, seeing them as possible partners in uncovering the island’s mysteries. He tells them about a “strange inscription by a crystal mound” and many adventurers have perished trying to decipher it.

### Abandoned Mineshafts
On the outskirts of Ironwood, the old abandoned mines hold secrets long buried. Adventurers can explore the mines and encounter hazards like unstable tunnels, aggressive wildlife, or mysterious glyphs etched into the walls. Deep within the mines, strange glowing rocks have been discovered sparking rumors of ancient magic or powerful minerals. Players can investigate and potentially find precious metals, magical runes, or just… rocks.
Players can find a geode and complete a strength check:
**Below 10**: The rock crumbles into dust. You hurt yourself and take 3 damage.
**Below 15**: Extraction of small mana crystals that sell for a high price.
**Above or equal 15**: Recover a Luminate Crystal that glows with suspicious energy.

### Underground Brawls
Hidden beneath the tavern lies an illicit fighting ring, run with Edward Earl's reluctant approval. Fighters from all over the island come to test their strength, often taking on wild animals, or each other. The space is dimly lit with lanterns, and a crude chalkboard lists the evening's matchups. Adventurers can ask around and learn the island's secrets.
GM can give tips or hints on where to go or explore next.

## Trade Route: Banana Trail

### Foraging
Wild fruits, herbs, and plants grow abundantly along the route, offering the chance to gather ingredients for potions or simple snacks. However, not all that grows is safe. Some fruits look inviting, with bright colors and sweet scents, but poisonous berries and mushrooms lurk among the edible. Players can attempt to identify safe options with their knowledge of plants, or take a risk and sample what they find.
Players can scavenge a berry and perform an intelligence check.
**Below 5**: Players are unable to identify the berry. It is probably best to discard. Yields a Suspicious Berry, which has a 75% chance to take 5 HP of damage, and a 25% chance to recover 5 HP.
**Below 17**: Identify a Life Fruit, when consumed restores 10 HP.
**Above or equal 17**: Identify a Glowberry, it looks important yet inedible…

### Greenpath to the Crystal Mound
Where the rumored inscription is located. The path through Greenpath is dense with foliage, overgrown with vibrant ferns, twisting vines, and wildflowers that burst with color. Despite the jungle’s untamed nature, it’s clear that others have traveled this way before. Footprints and lost equipment suggest curious explorers have passed through. As the trail winds deeper, it leads to the Crystal Mound – a formation that seems out of place in the jungle's chaos. The mound is jagged and luminous, its translucent crystals catching and refracting light in dazzling patterns. At the top, a moss-covered stone pedestal holds a glowing inscription (see below), faint and enigmatic, drawing anyone who approaches into its mysterious aura. The air here feels heavier, charged with an energy both captivating and unsettling:
Hear the sky’s call
Where beaches sprawl
Among countless shores,
The place where winds must go.

Beneath the frost,
Where time is lost,
The frozen winds shall softly sing,
Of when the stars align with spring.

Where lifeless waters sleep,
And poisoned tides creep.
A buried key, secretly kept,
Awaits the brave where none have stepped.

## Wavecrest

Wavecrest is a bustling coastal town that thrives on the waters that surround it. With its vibrant harbor and clear blue waters, it’s a place where sailors, traders, and adventurers gather. The town is known for its laid-back yet hard working atmosphere, where the days are spent hauling in catches, crafting intricate fishing gear, and tending to the bustling port.


### Fish Market
Where the freshest catches of the day are sold. The market is always bustling, with vendors shouting to attract customers to their stalls, each displaying their best catches. The market is lined with barrels and crates of fish, oysters, and other exotic sea creatures. Locals barter for the best deals, and tourists seek seafood delicacies for their journeys. However recently, market prices have gone up dramatically, as the quality and quantity of catches have gone down, due to the unknown pollution.
Players can purchase a variety of seafood for their journey.

### Driftwood Exchange
The town’s go-to shop for adventurers and seafarers in need of gear. The shop is a cobbled-together structure of salvaged ship planks and fishing nets. Here, players can purchase or trade for basic adventuring supplies, armor, often made from durable yet lightweight materials like sharkskin or seaweed composites. Weapons such as tridents, harpoons, and short swords.
NPC: Elaine Marlow, The store’s owner, is a former smuggler turned merchant. She has a sharp wit, and a no-nonsense attitude. Elaine keeps a mix of practical items – like fishing spears, rope, and journey supplies.
Elaine is seeking specific ingredients, and if you manage to acquire and turn them in, she may reward you with one of her unique items from her smuggling days, such as Siren’s Net or Barrier of Protection.
If players give Luminate Crystal: receive Siren's Net:
A magical net that glows faintly and can immobilize targets that fail a DC 18 Force or Reaction check.
If players give Glowberry: receive Potion of Protection:
A potion that when consumed, blocks the next source of damage.

### The Docks
The docks are a lively yet chaotic hub of activity. Here, players can obtain a ship for passage to their next destination. Players can depart to the Tundra Isles, Thousand Isles, or the Dead Zone.


#### Moving On
Players should have found the poem, and should be using the beach town dock to depart to their chosen destination. Players should be awarded 20 EXP for finding the inscription and an additional 10 EXP for each Luminate Crystal or Glowberry they obtained. Additional EXP may be granted at GM discretion.

## The Thousand Isles

![Map of The Thousand Isles](../../../assets/archipelago/thousandIsles.png)

The Thousand Isles are home to the Southern Trading Hub, located on the largest of the islands. Despite it being much smaller than the Northern Trading Hub in the Tundra Isles, it’s still quite busy, with craftsmen, residents, and FLOoN employees alike scrambling to go about their business. The largest island holds the main part of town on the north side with the public docks, and a FLOoN corporate shipping center to the south. A few of the other big islands are made up of residential neighborhoods, and the rest of the smaller islands are mainly home to wildlife, but a micro-junkyard and small storage structure are housed on two of the furthest, smallest islands. Unless you already know your way around, the center of town is clearly the place to be:
In a somewhat stark contrast to the tropical atmosphere and breezy, palm-laden architecture, the Southern Trading Hub is buzzing with activity and packed with people. In the open air of the town square, the only visible structure above the sea of heads is a tall, magnificent stone statue of an incredibly muscular man with a human body and a pelican’s head. In the crowd, swarms of locals carry stacks of boxes and crates towards the docks, as shoppers loiter and, notably, a middle-aged woman at the raised entrance of the general store surveys the crowd, her eyes lingering suspiciously long on your party as she looks around.

## Town

The main center for all the action, the town should serve as the starting point for the party’s journey. In its stilted, palm-wood structures, the town is home to many shops, an inn, and the (in)famous statue of the town’s founder, known by locals as Pelican Jee.

### General Store

The general store sells general stuff, of course. It is owned and run by a middle-aged human woman named Arden. Despite appearing only 40 or so, it is clear from her tired eyes and wrinkled face that her best years are behind her. Vigilant and somewhat suspicious of newcomers, but not unfriendly, she likes to stand outside the shop and watch the crowd go by. This is supposedly to people-watch, but most of the town knows she just likes to keep tabs on everything. When she isn’t people-watching, Arden’s other favorite hobby is sticking her nose into everyone’s business, all the time. She’s not malicious, and is actually quite kind if you approach her, just straightforward. She needs to know why you’re here. She’s also mostly harmless, unless you ask too many questions about her younger years as a cloudrunner. Then she might get mad. 
Arden’s been living here for a long time, and she’s a critical source of information around town. If you ask a local about something they haven’t heard of, they’ll send you to the general store. The most recent town gossip is that “that guy” has retreated into the house again. Any questions about who she’s talking about are met with either confusion or more vague insistence on, “you know, that guy.” She doesn’t seem to actually know their name.
Specific to this adventure, Arden knows there was an ancient riddle etched into a massive rock when Pelican Jee first got to The Thousand Isles. Reportedly, he left it in its place on the south side of the largest island, but it’s unclear what happened to it when FLOoN used the land to build their shipping center. She remembers hearing rumors that they had kept it and displayed it on-site in the small office building on the shipping center grounds. She also knows that Pelican Jee took detailed notes of his adventures, and it’s likely he has the riddle written down somewhere. He still lives on the next island over. 

### The Bubble

A simple inn and tavern, The Bubble serves the community as a place to rest, drink, and sleep. On any given day, it is home to many travelers and tired sailors, savoring their day off.

### The Statue

Located in the center of town, the stone statue is around 7ft tall and depicts a majestic, fit young man posing victoriously with his hands on his hips. Strangely, his only non-human feature is his head, which is that of a pelican and seems much too big for his body. Despite its impeding, conspicuous appearance, no one seems to be paying it any mind. On the front of the round base is a plaque that reads:
OUR MAGNIFICENT PELICAN JEE, the great Avenari adventurer, founded this town with nothing but the supplies in his bill and a dream. When he discovered the Thousand Isles, looking for a piece of land to rest on as the winds got worse, he decided it would be his permanent home. Today, it is still a home, but also a thriving trading port!

## The Shipping Center
The Shipping Center is a local outpost of FLOoN’s operations. It handles any and all corporate shipments and trades that come through the Thousand Isles. Its grounds, marked by large metal fencing, take up almost half of the island. While most of this area is open land used for cargo and shipment crates, there are two buildings of note; one is the guardhouse, located at the north entrance, and the other is a wide, single story building that houses administrative offices.  

### The Guardhouse
The guardhouse sits at the only obvious entrance of the Shipping Center, next to two large metal doors. Unsurprisingly, it seems like approaching it is the only legitimate way to gain entry to the grounds. Manning the window is a young puffin Avenar that looks bored out of his mind. His name is Taron. He is angsty, straightfaced, and seems to have little concern for anything except finishing his shift. He clearly cares very little about the company’s property or safety, but he at least cares a little about not getting yelled at by his manager. He will refuse to let you in, at least not without an excuse to get him out of trouble if you’re caught. Here, it is recommended that Taron’s willingness to collaborate with the party be based on their current karma score. He could let the party in, but he knows there is heavy security inside and they likely wouldn’t get very far anyway. If a party’s karma is particularly low, Taron may conveniently forget to mention the other guards. He also knows FLOoN keeps spare uniforms in their storage unit on one of the far islands, and he may be willing to “mistake” a party with high enough karma for employees if they’re wearing the right thing. No matter the party’s karma, Taron is still an apathetic twerp; he eventually gives into pressure, and the party can convince him to open the doors anyway with a DC 14 Leadership or Fear check. Encountering the interior guards without obtaining uniforms for any reason will require the party to pass a DC 14 Sneakiness check. Getting caught may bring serious consequences, such as combat, increased security, or even being assumed cloudrunners, making you a known corporate target. Enemy combatants can be assumed to be corporate soldiers.

### The Offices

This is a small, single story office building where all of the administrative parts of shipping and trading are handled. Just inside the main entrance is a small lobby with the receptionist’s desk and multiple display cases lining the walls. The receptionist, a burly parrot Avenar, is fast asleep behind the desk. It is up to the GM’s discretion if an action taken while in the room risks waking the receptionist. The cases are filled with artifacts, photos, and plaques detailing the many achievements of FLOoN over the years. It seems at first to be a sort of museum, but upon further inspection, any negative, pollutant, or destructive parts of the company’s history are conspicuously absent, making it more of a shrine than anything else. In one case is a large stone slab, about four feet high, leaned against the wall, with rough, sharp letters carved into it. It reads: In the place where the land slopes to the heavens, a legend awaits among the leafy cluster of a long-lost oracle.

![Guide of a Corporate Solider](../../../assets/archipelago/corporateSoldier.png)

### The Loading Dock

As you approach the water, the land transitions into a vast concrete slab. This is the loading dock, where large corporate ships can dock and exchange cargo. It is mostly filled with crates and cargo. At the GM's discretion, undercover party members may be able to complete a DC 10 Thievery check to swipe an item from the boxes.

## Residential Isles

### ”That Guy”

Directly next to Pelican Jee’s home is a significantly smaller, run-down looking house. Upon knocking or entering, the party, surprisingly, is greeted by a sheepish young woman, around twenty years old. She has a strange, almost neurotic energy about her, which is only fed by the detective-like pinboard with red string she seems to be working on. She is defensively insistent that she is the only one living in the house. If anyone brings up her being referred to as “that guy,” she will respond with insulted annoyance. Apparently, her name is Guy, but some of the community is having an unnecessarily hard time wrapping their heads around this, and gossiping locals seem to have jumped to the conclusion that there’s a reclusive man living with her that they’ve never seen before. She seems annoyed by this frequent, unnecessarily complicated misunderstanding.

She’ll let the party look through the journal and give it back to her, but how much she opens up about her research is dependent on her trust in the party. Guy is a quiet, law-abiding citizen, but has lately been picking up on information about FLOoN’s operations that are concerning to her. Seemingly, this has led to a number of anxious, home-grown conspiracy theories, some more realistic than others.
Despite the faded paper and ink, flipping through the journal reveals a sketch drawing of a large stone slab with sharp letters carved into it. They read: In the place where the land slopes to the heavens, a legend awaits among the leafy cluster of a long-lost oracle.

### The Founder

Pelican Jee’s house is on an island just next to the main one, and is only a quick walk through the water from town. Upon knocking on the door or entering the home, the party meets Pelican Jee, the founder of town and, seemingly, folk hero of the earliest residents. In a shocking contrast to the towering, chiseled figure depicted in the statue, Jee is now a jovial, hunched old man, standing not much more than 4 ft tall. The statue was, however, perfectly accurate in depicting his avenari features; that is, he has an entirely human body, lacking the bird wings found in most avenari, and a round, disproportionately large pelican head. He is enthusiastic and ecstatic at anyone showing interest in his adventuring stories, but he has seemingly become quite senile. He gets off-track easily, rambling about his many adventures, and, when hurried or pushed, can’t seem to remember what you were asking about in the first place. However, he does remember finding some sort of “boulder of bewilderment,” as he insists on calling it, and he remembers writing down the riddle. Jee’s memory lags from there though, with him having no recollection of the actual contents of the passage. He informs the party that he just lent his old notebook to “that guy” who lives next door for research purposes, and that they’d have to go retrieve it from the next house over if they want to read the riddle. Any sort of question surrounding the identity of “that guy” seems to be met with another bout of confused elderly rambling.

## Smaller Islands

### The Junkyard

It is, quite literally, a giant mound of trash. It smells. There’s no reason to believe it houses anything special. However, on a DC 20 Awareness check, a player character may see a glimmer in the rubble. Upon further inspection, it appears to be a small metal locket, stamped with the skycaller symbol. Inside is a single photo of a young girl, around 4 or 5, laughing as the wind jostles her hair. There are no other notable markings, nor indications of who it may have belonged to. It radiates an air of importance somehow, but, being intricate and made of metal, it would also sell for a decent sum in any region of the archipelago. Players are unable to deduce its owner, unless the party has already learned of Veltharion’s daughter. The locket belonged to Veltharion herself, and holds an image of her daughter when she was young.

### The Storage Facility

Despite being referred to as a “facility,” the storage on this island appears to be little more than a high-tech shipping crate with an intimidating vault door, and a touchscreen keypad prompting you to enter your employee identification number. Neither Taron nor the receptionist are of a high enough clearance to access the storage. However, on a DC 12 mechanics check a player can investigate and ultimately force open the vault door, or, on a DC 12 cybernetics check, a player can manipulate the software and open the lock digitally. Inside there are mainly stacks and stacks of worthless, mundane office supplies, but near the door there is a box of FLOoN Shipping uniform shirts in a large array of sizes.

#### Moving On
The party should have found the riddle: In the place where the land slopes to the heavens, a legend awaits among the leafy cluster of a long-lost oracle. This riddle points them towards the Isle of Omphalos (the middle island run by FLOoN) as their final destination. They might also have found Veltharion’s Locket in the Junkyard, which may come in handy in their confrontation with Veltharion. A ship to their next destination should be able to be easily chartered to their next destination from the Trading Hub, except for the Dead Zone which may require more convincing or a sympathetic Cloudrunner willing to let them try to sail the skies. Cloudrunning requires a single-person kite-like vehicle and a high jumping-off point. To successfully Cloudrun, everyone must pass three DC 10 Reaction or Vehicles checks before two failures or crash in the ocean. Players should be awarded 40 EXP for finding the riddle, however they went about it, with 20 additional EXP if they found the locket in the Junkyard. Extra EXP may be awarded at GM discretion.

## The Tundra Isles

![Map of the Tundra Isles](../../../assets/archipelago/tundraIsles.png)

## Northern Trading Hub

Despite being the smallest island of the three in the Tundra Isles, the Trading Hub is always packed with activity. Ships of all shapes and sizes are docked or moving towards the many ports on the island - everything from heavy corporate cargo ships to ferries to lightweight personal sailboats. However your players arrive at this island, they’re immediately thrown into a chaotically busy environment:
A cacophony of sounds greet you as you arrive at the Northern Trading Hub. Captains shout orders at deckhands hastily loading or unloading cargo, cutting through the din of shopkeepers hawking their wares from stalls that line the docks. As soon as one ship leaves, it seems that two more take its place. By the incoming ferries, a man rolling a food cart skillfully weaves his way through the dockworkers, selling what appears to be some kind of meat on a stick to whoever is unlucky enough to wander too close. The waves crash with tremendous force against the wooden docks, giving the air a salty quality that permeates the entire environment. 

### Shops

Pretty much everything you can think of is sold somewhere in the maze of stalls, supplied by the constant stream of ships and people. Along with the food vendor on the docks, two notable shops are a shop selling mountaineering equipment and a florist’s stall.
Mikey’s Mountaineering is run by the titular Mikey - a tall, very muscular human with a front tooth missing. Despite his appearance, Mikey is a kind soul who likes to crack bad jokes and spread his love of exploration to his customers. Mikey sells helmets, ice picks, crampons, thick boots, and complicated rope systems for climbing. He offers a rental package for a small, relatively affordable fee. However, if the party mentions their intent to climb the tallest mountain he’ll let them rent sets of gear for free if they deliver a letter to his grandmother, Eudora, who lives near the peak of that mountain, and bring back her response. He will also be very open with information about climbing conditions, heavily suggesting cold weather clothing and at least 3 days of extra rations for the trip if they seem unprepared.
Regal Blossoms (Bouquets fit for a Queen!) is a floral shop managed by an elderly peacock Avenar, Victoria. Victoria is quite energetic for her age, yelling about how good of a deal her flowers are right alongside the rest of the shopkeepers. Her selection of flowers spans all varieties, but most of them are red, orange, and yellow. A smaller number of purple, blue, and green flowers are scattered around as well, and a single white rose is framed above Victoria’s head in the back of the stall. Should the party ask about the white rose, Victoria will tell them about the concentric rings of colored flowers on the Fields of Asphodel (reddish colors on the outside, blues inner, and rare white flowers from the very center), and regale them with how these white flowers only bloom once a month and are rumored to have magical properties. A bouquet can be bought for cheap, but the white rose is extremely expensive.
Doug’s Mysterious Meat Cart is a greasy food cart run by a man who is almost as mysterious as the meat product he sells, referring to himself only by “Doug.” Seemingly a typical con man in a trench coat, he will approach the party if they arrive by ferry, trying to get them to buy his meat on a stick. At no point is the type of meat specified, but it is “certified 100% genuine meat”, “free ranged”, and “cooked to perfection”. It looks like a very charred hot dog on a stick. Although persistent, he will give up and move on if the party does not engage with him. If someone buys one of his meat sticks, he will give them an intricate compass from his coat that points towards the shrine on Fields of Asphodel as a “first time customer gift” with an overly exaggerated wink, after which he will move on and disappear into the crowds even if the party tries to stop him. The heavy silver compass has the Skycaller symbol in the middle, with a blooming flower where North would be, a crescent moon to the South, a bee to the West, and a budding flower to the East. It also has a hidden button (DC 10 Awareness or Mechanics check) that seemingly does nothing, but actually emits high frequency sound that can quell the bees in the Flower Field.

### Amenities and Transportation
Along with the shops there are multiple busy taverns and inns along the docks.
The **Salty Seagull** is a tavern that is filled with sailors and dockworkers. Drunkenness is rampant and fights are common, but you might be able to convince someone to give you a ride to a neighboring island if you try hard enough.
The **Driftwood Inn** is the primary lodging in the Trading Hub, where people can buy meals and have a place to stay for the night. The innkeeper could have some knowledge on general area lore or know how to get to the other islands in this area.
The **Gilded Anchor** is an upscale, corporate-dominated pub that most non-corporate types steer clear from. However, you might be able to find a sponsored ferry or someone willing to take a bribe to get you where you need to go.
The sea between the three islands in this quadrant are filled with icebergs, making them treacherous for inexperienced sailors. Should the party attempt to sail these waters themselves instead of using a local, the party will need to make relevant checks to ensure they can navigate correctly. If the group collectively gets five failures before three successes, they will crash and need to be rescued by another ship.


## Fields of Asphodel

## Introduction and Landscape

Compared to the chaos of the trading hub, this island is serene. There’s small docks along the coast, with cottages sparsely dotting the skyline, wide paths lazily winding between them. Everywhere you look, flowers of all different colors and shapes cover the ground like grass. Most people here are friendly to tourists, but they came here to get away from the hustle and bustle of other islands so they don’t take kindly to disturbances. Along the northwestern path out of town a short fence stands before a sea of red flowers with signs along it reading “Please do not trample the flowers!” The fence sags slightly farther down the path, and a trail of flattened flowers leads into the field - someone obviously didn’t heed the sign. This is the start of the concentric flower rings.

### Concentric Flower Rings

The rings of flowers are organized in the following order (outer to inner): red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple. The outer rings gradually transition into each other - orange flowers becoming more and more common among the red until the orange eventually dominates - while the inner rings have very stark transitions. The flowers also get taller the closer to the center you go, with the purple flowers living on bushes 5 feet tall. There are a few rough paths scattered throughout the red, orange and yellow rings, but they must push through the flowers starting in the green zone.

When the characters start to enter the yellow zone, they will notice someone running full speed down a path. If they are on the path, he heads straight toward them. A faint buzzing can also be heard, growing louder as a swarm of bees chases the person down the path. If the person running encounters the party, he will hastily push through them and keep running, calling them fools for just standing there. He is openly wearing corporate-branded clothing and has many noticeable welts on his face, presumably from bee stings. If the party does not hide among the flowers (DC 8 Sneakiness group check), the bees will head towards them and attack, stinging a few times before flying off towards the center. If the party has the compass and has activated the secret button, the bees become docile whenever they get close, dispersing from the swarm and collecting nectar from flowers.

![Guide of Swarm of Bees](../../../assets/archipelago/SwarmOfBees.png)

### Center of the Rings

As the party pushes through the purple ring, the flowers abruptly end in a small clearing. In the center of this clearing stands a cracked stone altar with a small tree growing on top of it. A DC 12 Awareness or Investigation check spots a beehive in one of the lower branches of the tree, right above the front of the altar. If characters do not approach with cautionary measures or draw attention to themselves, two swarms of bees will exit the hive and defend their territory. These swarms will not leave the clearing.

### Cracked Altar

This altar is identical to the altar on top of Mount Neverest. The front of this altar is intricately carved, split into two panels. The left panel depicts a rose twisting up a mountain, blooming as it reaches the sky. The right panel is cracked as a tree root has punched through the middle of the carving, but part of the inscription can still be read:
When life blooms… …form the trail
(This combines with the identical altar on the peak of the mountain to read: 
When life blooms in the silvered light of the slivered moon, the bees form the trail)
A single budding flower grows in the soil at the base of the tree on the altar. When exposed to the light of a crescent moon, it will bloom into a White Rose. As hinted by the inscription, players must bring the white rose to the Isle of Omphalos on the night of a crescent moon, allowing it to bloom and show them the way to the entrance of Veltharion’s Lagoon. The players are able to leave the rings without incident and make their way back to the docks.


## Ivory Peaks

### Introduction and Landscape

Mountains dominate this island, but one towers above the rest - Mount Neverest. The ultimate challenge for a mountain climber, Mount Neverest is known to take the lives of at least 20 climbers every year. The landscape is a tundra, everything covered in a thick layer of snow and ice. The adjoining town to the dock looks like a small ski village, offering lodging for mountain climbers and tourists. The party can talk to locals, who will warn them of the danger but wish them luck climbing the mountain. None of them have seen anything on top of the mountain, but legends say it was a holy site in the past.

### Climbing The Mountain

The mountain towers before the party, a soft snow falling from the sky, coating the ground in a thin layer of slick snow. Climbing Mount Neverest is no easy task, and the characters should have mountaineering equipment, cold weather equipment, and extra food with them. If they don’t, they can find some at a lodge (for an upcharge of course), or perhaps they can convince a local to let them borrow their gear for a short time. Later checks will be much more difficult if they go unprepared. Every night spent on the mountain gets harder and harder as characters start to succumb to the cold - each night gives the players a -1 penalty to all d20 rolls that persists until they rest at the bottom of the mountain again. If they don’t have cold weather gear or run out of food, they get an extra -1 penalty per night. Each person may make 10 checks to climb the mountain per day before they have to rest for the night.
The base of the mountain is a relatively easy climb - trails are clearly marked, other hikers are enjoying the view at different points along the way, and the weather isn’t too bad. However, about halfway up the mountain the wind starts to strengthen, sending howling gales across the mountain and turning the gentle snow into a stinging blizzard. All characters must pass a DC 15 Health check or become hypothermic, giving disadvantage to all checks until they can warm up. If characters are dressed appropriately, they get a +5 bonus to their roll. If they try to wait out the storm by finding shelter, they will quickly realize that this weather is more or less permanent, the wind never resting.
Pressing onward, the trail starts to fade until it disappears completely. The party has now entered the cloud layer on the mountain, a dense mist covering everything making it hard to see and the soft snow turning into hard chips of ice. Eventually, a faint glowing light can be seen a little further up the mountain (Eudora’s house). However, the way forward is completely blocked by a huge ice shelf. This can be scaled using climbing equipment and a DC 12 Climbing check. Without gear it can be climbed with a DC 20 Climbing check, but every failure carries risk of injury or falling into a crevasse. If players cannot find another way to climb the ice shelf, they can go around it but it will take an extra day of travel, forcing them to find a cave or other shelter to sleep in at night.

### Eudora’s House

Eudora’s log cabin is nestled along a wall of ice, similar to the one the party climbed to get here. It’s seemingly protected from the wind since the wind dies down to the softest it’s been since they stepped foot on the mountain when they approach the door. A brightly colored knitted welcome mat lies in front of the door and a heavy wooden knocker hangs on the door with a sign that reads “No Soliciting!” The inside of the house is very cozy with small trinkets, such as a miniature cactus wearing a knitted pink sweater labeled ‘Cuddles’, adorning nearly every flat surface. Eudora greets them warmly and insists they come in for dinner and stay the night. If they give her Mikey’s letter, she is overjoyed and will write a response for the party to bring back. 
Eudora is a very old human who loves to call people dear and take care of the “young ‘uns.” She is also an incredibly powerful Skycaller (not that she advertises it), which is why the winds around her house are so calm. If there is a Skycaller in the party she will take a particular interest in them, whether they reveal they’re a Skycaller or not. Eudora knows about the shrines and Veltharion’s quest, but she will speak only of things ‘said in legends and stories’. She will also offer to take the party to the shrine on the mountain in the morning. If asked about the purpose of the shrines or quest in general, she will tell a legend about an ancient Skycaller ritual that purifies the soul and extends lifespan. 
After a hearty dinner, Eudora will give the party heavy blankets to sleep. If they spend the night here, they do not incur the penalty for spending a night on the mountain. In the morning, Eudora leads them to the shrine if they want. While Eudora is with them, the wind stays very calm.

### Shrine at the Peak

This altar is identical to the altar in the middle of the Flower Field. If the snow is cleared off the top of the altar, the perfectly flat and smooth surface has the Skycaller symbol carved into it. Most details on the sides of the altar have been worn away over time, but the front of the altar is split into two panels. The left panel depicts a flower blooming under a crescent moon, while the right panel has an inscription. The edges are faded, but the middle can be read:
…in the silvered light of the slivered moon, the bees…
This combines with the Flower Field altar to read:
When life blooms in the silvered light of the slivered moon, the bees form the trail
If Eudora is present, she can help make sense of the altar and guide the players on what they need to do next. 
Returning From the Peak
The climb down is just as hard as the climb up. Have one of the players make a DC 14 Deduction check to see if they can retrace their steps. Eudora can give this check advantage. On a success, two DC 10 climbing checks are required on the way down (DC 18 without mountaineering gear). On a failure, the pathway down is more treacherous, requiring three checks of your choice rather than 2 Climbing checks. Players can suffer damage or health conditions if they fail, but they should be able to eventually make it down regardless.

#### Moving On

Before characters leave this quadrant, they should have collected one White Rose (budding) and know the inscription: When life blooms in the silvered light of the slivered moon, the bees form the trail. The inscription tells the players that they must bring the White Rose to the location described in the Thousand Isles (the Isle of Omphalos) during a crescent moon, where it will bloom and attract bees to guide them to their destination.
If Eudora’s letter is brought back to Mikey he will be extremely happy and thank the party. If asked, he will let on that his grandmother went in hiding from the corporation and he can’t see her often because nobody can survive the winds of Mount Neverest for very long (besides her it seems).

Transportation to any other island except the Dead Zone can be relatively easily arranged, either through corporate ferries to the Southern Trading Hub or Corporate Island, or a sailor heading to the Beach. Cloudrunning to another island is easiest from any of the mountains on the Ivory Peaks. Cloudrunning requires a single-person kite-like vehicle and a high jumping-off point. To successfully Cloudrun, everyone must pass three DC 10 Reaction or Vehicles checks before two failures or crash in the ocean. Players should be awarded 50 EXP for obtaining the White Rose and putting together the inscriptions. 10 additional EXP is awarded for delivering Eudora’s message to Mikey or obtaining the compass from Doug. Extra EXP may be awarded at GM discretion.


## The Dead Zone

![Map of the Dead Zone](../../../assets/archipelago/isleOfDeath.png)

Of all the islands in the Aeolian Archipelago, none have more mystery surrounding them than the Dead Zone. Formerly known as Eros Island, the Dead Zone was once a thriving cloudrunner community before it disappeared into the fog. Some decades after the Great Floods, the shifting regional climate caused a thick fog to descend upon the island which remains today, making the dense mangrove swamps of Tharun Swamps dangerously unnavigable. Today, the swamps of Eros Island and the ruins of Port Eros are all but hidden behind the fog, with only the peak of Mount Eros poking out of the top. While it’s common sense that nothing could possibly worth entering the fog of the Dead Zone, there have been whispers of a forgotten rare herb of great importance to FLOoN that once grew on the slopes of Mount Eros…

## Beneath The Fog

### Port Eros

Port Eros is the ruins of a once-thriving Cloudrunner community that was abandoned once the fog descended. Formerly a thriving trading port, all that’s left of Port Eros are dilapidated, weathered buildings. Port Eros formerly relied on exports of rare herbs growing in Tharun Swamps, but was abandoned when the descending fog made the swamps far too dangerous to navigate. Players will be hard-pressed to find any sailors willing to transport them directly to Port Eros, as the dense fog makes it far too dangerous to dock at the ruined port, but some could perhaps be reluctantly convinced to sail close to the island, with the party swimming the rest of the way. Most sailors will know that Port Eros was formerly located on the side of the island closest to the central island. A more direct, but more dangerous, route is to cloudrun directly to the dock.
Port Eros was built around a lighthouse that sits near the shore of the island; it is by far the tallest building in Port Eros. If players choose to climb the (slightly rickety) lighthouse, passing a simple Perception check at the top will reveal a faint blue glow in the direction of Mount Eros. As players pass through abandoned streets of Port Eros, they may choose to loot abandoned supplies, finding helpful items such as rope, torches, and a map of the island. Maps will reveal that the island consists of Mount Eros at the center, completely surrounded by the Tharun Swamps, with Port Eros on the southwest end of the island. Certain herb gathering spots are marked on the map. The largest mark sits at the base of Mount Eros, marked by a stormcaller emblem, roughly in the direction of the blue glow players may have seen at the top of the lighthouse. Small wooden boats can easily be found all along the swamp side of Port Eros.

### Tharun Swamps

Tharun Swamps are the fog-covered saltwater marshes that compose most of the Dead Zone. Densely covered by mangrove forests, some kind of boat is surely necessary to navigate it, though they are easily found in the abandoned ruins in Port Eros. While it used to be teeming with wildlife, nowadays the Tharun Swamps are eerily silent. The fog makes the Tharun Swamps extremely dangerous to navigate, filled with quicksand, hidden pits, and muddy water. Players will need to make Awareness checks to successfully avoid these traps, and if falling into them, will need to make Agility or Strength checks to escape them. If a Skycaller is present in the party, the fog can be manipulated to a minor extent to clear the path forward. Softly glowing Blue Harra Lilies seem to mark a path through the swamp, heading towards Mount Eros.

### Mount Eros

Mount Eros is the rocky mountain that sits at the center of the Dead Zone; its peak is the only part of Eros Island visible to the outside. Before the fog descended upon Eros Island, Mount Eros was of great importance to skycallers, revered as the place where the legendary Veltharion the Tidebinder first appeared, ushering thousands up the slopes of Mount Eros as the waters rose. Many of these survivors went on to establish Port Eros after the Floods ended. Growing on the slopes of Mount Eros are the rare Blue Harra Lilies, which glow a soft blue easily visible through the fog of the Dead Zone.
Blue Harra Glade
Blue Harra Glade is a massive flower glade at the base of Mount Eros, located at the edge of Tharun Swamp. The fog is lifted in the glade; clear blue sky is visible above the flowers, and the peak of Mount Eros can almost be seen. A slight path of trampled flowers leading to the center of the glade can be seen. At the center of the glade players will find a torn page of the following journal entry:


<span style="font-family: Monaco, Courier New, monospace;"> The winds have not been kind to me, nor to the land I once swore to protect. The very breath of nature now feels like a curse, whispering of all that I have lost.
I thought I was saving her. I thought the deal was simple—a compromise, a small surrender to protect her. Sky… my sweet Sky. I should have known the moment I spoke her name, the moment I gave them that key, that it would never be that simple.
They forced me to bend the storm to their whims, to turn the rains and the winds into weapons of their ambition. I raised the seas at their command, reshaped the skies like clay beneath my hands. But each thunderclap, each surge of the tide, has torn at my soul. I knew I was making a cruel mockery of the hallowed forces I once swore to protect with. But it wasn’t for me. It was for her.
The price they demanded was too high, too twisted to be borne by any soul. But in the end, it was never their threats that cracked me. It was the thought of her face, the look in her eyes when she finally saw what I had become. I will carry that shame with me to my grave.
Sky, the key. The password that locked my heart away. I should have never trusted them. But now, it’s too late. Too late for the world. Too late for me. </span>

<span style="font-family: Monaco, Courier New, monospace;"> Maybe the sea will take me. Maybe the winds will call me back to where I belong. But before the tide rises again, I leave these words for whoever may come here after me. You may find my bones in the end, or the ashes of a spirit too broken to rise again. But the word Sky—that is the key. The only way to break their grip. The only way to find the storm beneath their control.
I don’t know who will read this, or if anyone ever will. But if you do… know this: you must protect her. Do not let them use her name again. </span>

<span style="font-family: Monaco, Courier New, monospace;"> I have no more tears left to shed, no more storms to call. Only echoes.
May the tides rise again, and may they wash away this stain.
V </span>

#### Moving On

After reading Veltharion’s journal entry in the Blue Harra Glade, players can exit the region by either climbing Mount Eros and cloudrunning from the peak, or sailing back out to Port Eros. Navigation through Tharun Swamp is relatively easy back to Port Eros as the Blue Harra Lilies mark the way back to the port, and the fog slightly thins out further from the mountain. Players may have made an arrangement with the sailor who took them to the island to wait for them so they can return; if not, perhaps the sailor stayed in the area out of concern for the party. Many small wooden boats lie abandoned on the coast of Port Eros which can be commandeered to link back up with the sailor.
In terms of cloudrunning from the peak, climbing Mount Eros is relatively easy as the many skycaller pilgrims of the past have created a well-worn trail leading to the peak of the mountain, although it is slightly overgrown as the path has not been tread for a long time. Players may cut through the foliage with any tools they may have; if they have no such methods of cutting through the overgrowth, they may pass with a DC 10 Agility or Strength check. As they near the peak, the fog gradually thins out, and the peak itself is completely above the fog layer. From here, the party may cloudrun to the next island.
40 EXP should be awarded to players for braving the Dead Zone and finding the journal entry. An additional 10 EXP may be given for Cloudrunning onto and/or off the island. Extra EXP may be awarded at GM discretion

## Isle of Omphalos

![Map of Isle of Omphalos](../../../assets/archipelago/isleOfOmphalos.png)

Located in the center of the Aeolian Archipelago, the Isle of Omphalos is visible from all quadrants of the region. Being home to both the densest of forests on its southern border and the steepest of cliffs on its north, the Isle of Omphalos almost appears as if it was a crashing wave. Its rich and diverse vegetation has made it the centerpiece for FLOoN control within the archipelago. At the island’s peak of elevation which faces north, FLOoN has built seven buildings to act as a regional headquarters, displayed in the shape of a crescent with buildings growing in size from the outer edge to the middle.

## Locations

### Tangle of Delphi 

Occupying about three-quarters of the island, and beginning from the beaches of the southern edge, this area is an incredibly dense and lucious jungle. Filled with vines and large canopies, very little sunlight is able to pass through to the earth. This also impacts the humidity of the tangle, acting more similarly to a tropical rainforest. With the island being one gradual hill, traveling by foot can become difficult in this tangle if the correct provisions are not made. Based on the clues the party has collected from the previous islands, this is the area in which the opening to FLOoN Lagoon would be.

### Horizon’s Edge 

The northern quarter of the island escapes the dense jungle of Delphi’s Tangle, and now is an open field featuring thick blades of grass going to about shin to knee-height. Here is where FLOoN has situated their base within the archipelago, with their looming HQs structured as if the peak of the island was an arena. The sky is now visible, but with the regional temperatures it is never clear. Almost stormy in nature, the cliffs bring about a feeling of malice. The sharp falloff of the cliffs at the isle’s edge match that of a crescent on a tidal wave. If the party chooses to engage against FLOoN, this would certainly be the perfect battlefield.

### FLOoN Lagoon

Hidden away within the Tangle of Delphi, lies the peaceful lagoon used by Veltharion as a place of peace, meditation, and rest. The entrance is that of moving trees, which bend away from one another once the password is entered into the nearby stone wall (see Journey Into the Jungle). Upon entering, the lagoon appears to be a small circle, with an outer ring of mosses and old, broken stone walls., remnants of an old city before the flooding. In the center lies a small pond, topped with a multitude of colorful water lilies and lily pads. The shallow pond is not murky, and actually has perfectly transparent water that lies completely still. The Lagoon has no ambiance, acting as a piece of complete silence and peace. The place feels like it is frozen in time.

## Journey Into the Jungle

By reaching this point in the campaign, the party should now have in their possession: a copy/note of the Poem of the Jungle from the Thousand Isles, the budding White Rose and the inscription from the Tundra Isles, and the Veltharion’s journal entry from the Dead Zone.
If the party has Veltharion’s Locket from the Junkyard, they can skip the entire final fight by returning it to Veltharion.

From whichever of the islands marked the party’s third piece to the poem, they enter Omphalos Island from its southern beach. The party is aware that this is the home to FLOoN, as well as their militias and resources, so the party must know to be as careful as possible heading into the tangle. This is essentially an espionage mission. 
As the party makes their way through the dense tangle, there can be numerous moments where Health and group Sneakiness checks are necessary (at GM discretion) where pods of corporate soldiers pass through the tangle, acting as both guards and explorers trying to find the same secret entrance. It is advised in this case for the party to not engage in combat, as this would lead to unwanted attention from FLOoN and will force the party to retreat, pushing them back to the bottom of the tangle (comparable to the story of Sisyphus pushing up the boulder, one mistake and the party must start again).
When the party finally reaches the clearing of Horizon’s Edge, and they can finally see the light from a crescent moon, they can bring out the White Rose collected from the Tundra Isles. In doing so, the flower will begin to bloom. As the petals expand, the party will begin to hear a slight hum. Ever so growing, the hum will turn to a buzz, and a louder buzz, and a louder buzz. 
The party will witness a swarm of bees moving out of the clearing towards them, attracted to the rose. The swarm will begin to cycle around the holder of the rose, and a DC 10 Insight check reveals that the swarm is not hostile. Using a Deduction check (GM discretion), a member of the party will be able to decipher that the bees were the clue from the tundra isles. If not attacked or scared off, the bees will take pollen from the rose and fly back the way they came, leading the party to the entrance to FLOoN Lagoon. Additional Tracking, Awareness, or Deduction checks may be necessary to follow the bees through the dense foliage. 
Moving back into the tangle, the party will continue following the swarm of bees until reaching a wide pass where only one tree resides. A large, grand willow tree is seen, seeming large enough to be viewable from anywhere on the island, yet can only be seen now once directly in front of it. As the party approaches, they should notice a door-like shape in the center of the tree’s trunk, but there is no handle or knob to open with. Looking to the right, they will notice a large stone wall with multiple rings on it. Approaching it will reveal twenty circular rings protruding left to right. A Mechanics or Deduction check at GM discretion will reveal that this is a place to enter a password 20 characters long, but an additional Intuition check will allow the party to cleverly figure out that the passkey comes from the journal and is SKY, with the other seventeen characters remaining obsolete. This solution can also be reached through player knowledge alone, no checks required.
Once entered, the door within the trunk of the willow will open, and once entering the party will be in FLOoN Lagoon. The silent arena has only one occupant: Veltharion, who is meditating on a throne across from the still water. Upon seeing uninvited guests to her sacred space, Veltharion will attack, setting off the Aeolian Archipelago’s final boss fight. 
This is NOT a fight that can be won by brute strength or spells, but rather by deducing Veltharion's position, a worried mother trying to protect their child. Veltharion should use a wide range of attacks, both with spells and her staff. Remember to use her Reflect reaction whenever applicable.
Once the party realizes her connection to Sky and talks her down, or gives her the locket before the fight starts, Veltharion will calm down and approach the party to talk. She will tell her story to the party: how FLOoN forced her to work for them in threatening the safety of her daughter, how she comes to FLOoN Lagoon once a month to meditate, cleanse herself, and hopefully find a way to save Sky, and how she plans to one day overthrow FLOoN.

In agreeing to help Veltharion in this quest, whether directly or indirectly depending on how party chooses to move on from the archipelago, Veltharion will award the party with a gift: Veltharion’s Heaven Sent - a small glass box with a glowing red flower inside, filled with Skycaller energy, and essentially acting as a bomb when opened or broken, dealing 50d6 damage in a half mile radius. Veltharion will then tell the party that she is going back to the skies in search of her daughter, and the party will then remain alone in the calmness of FLOoN Lagoon.

### Moving On
The campaign of the Aeolian Archipelago has now ended, with the party being rewarded with the powers of the strongest Skycaller through her glass nuke. Players are rewarded with 50 more EXP for their efforts. The party can either choose to keep their treasure and retire back on the Beach, or can choose to explore with their newly acquired tool to another region within the world of Tides for Change. Wherever they go, Sky's the limit!
