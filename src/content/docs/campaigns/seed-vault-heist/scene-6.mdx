Above the laboratory is the roof of the seed vault. It is made of reflective glass and acts as a greenhouse. The greenhouse is used to grow some of the species of plants as food. Here MegaCorp grows everything from cabbage to corn. The plants are grown and tended by the robot farmers. The players are welcome to explore this area to learn information that can help them in the seed library. All of the plants are labeled with their scientific name (for higher level players they will need to remember this information for the seed vault). They will be able to see all of the grown versions of the seeds Ernest Elderberry tasked them with finding. Taking the plants alone is not enough to complete Ernestâ€™s request, however. The players must get the seeds from the seed vault. 


### Scientific Names of Seeds
- Peas --> *Pisum sativum*
- Wheat --> *Triticum*
- Corn --> *Zea mays*
- Rice --> *Oryza sativa*
- Beans --> *Phaseolus vulgaris*
- Squash --> *Cucurbita*

If the players looked through the laboratory drawers and found the old research on which plants help with healing, they can use this knowledge to find these specific plants in the greenhouse. If they choose to take some of these plants in preparation for their heist, they will face off with the farmer robots. If players are successful in fighting off the farmer robots, they will gain 10-20 XP.
