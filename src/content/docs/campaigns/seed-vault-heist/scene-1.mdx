The players have traveled far and wide and have now arrived in Grønn Verden. It’s their first night and they have gathered around the communal campfire in the center of the village to hear the stories of the Elders. Elder Ernest Elderberry (see below) approaches the newcomers and asks them what brought them to Grønn Verden. 

The next day, the players run into Ernest who is visibly distressed. He starts telling the players about his troubles. He sent a group of adventurers into the seed vault to steal seeds for the village, and he just got word they were caught by MegaCorp. He doesn’t know if they were successful in reaching the seed library or what they found on the inside. 

Eventually, Ernest asks the players if they can help him. He needs them to get the seeds from the seed vault to bring back a thriving farming community and restore biodiversity in Grønn Verden. The seeds he specifically needs are: Peas, Wheat, Corn, Rice, Beans, and Squash.

    - He cannot provide a physical map only a description
    - He is also to tell players how they must enter the seed vault
        - There is only one access point which is the garage door
