The storage of the seeds is below ground which is accessed by an elevator that descends into the ground. By traveling downwards, the temperature turns cooler so that the seeds can be refrigerated without using any power. This underground vault contains a library of seeds where each species is stored in a filing system composed of mobile shelving units. The location of each seed can be looked up using an electronic look-up table which is accessed by a tablet mounted on the wall. Each entry in the library contains a vial of the seeds for that species and each vial contains approximately 500 seeds. The size of the lower section is about half a square mile and contains seeds from about 100,000 species of phanerogams (a plant that produces seeds).

When they first enter the room, they see a nice reception area with tablets on the wall. These tablets are what the party can use to look up where in the vault the seeds they need are. This area is blocked off from the rest of the vault behind a large door. The players are welcome to choose to look up where the seeds they need are located within the vault on any of the tablets along the wall. (For parties level 5+ they will need to look up the scientific name for the plants found in the lab section of the vault).

Once entered into the seed library they will need to be careful to avoid the robot seed keepers (see below) stalking the hallways of the library. If the party had found the robot assembly blueprints from the office they are able to use that knowledge to attempt to peacefully disable the robots. The players can now find all the seeds they have been tasked to find from Elder Elderberry. The seeds have been spread out to different areas of the vault, but if the players chose to look up their locations it will be easier for them to find each objective.

As the players collect the seeds they should encounter more and more seed keepers as they are aware that seeds are starting to go missing. This will become more and more noticeable as the players get closer to collecting all of the seeds.
