After collecting all of the seeds from the library, all of the robot seed keepers will be made aware that the players have stolen many types of seeds from them. This will cause them to come to the players from seemingly nowhere. It is now that the players need to escape from the seed library and leave the vault as quickly as possible. The players only choice of escape route is the same way they entered the facility, so up into the loading dock and out into the outside world to deliver the seeds to people waiting in the village.
