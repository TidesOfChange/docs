The stairs from the unloading dock lead to the middle section of the building where the layout is made up of long hallways with old dorms and offices that are now unused. If anyone from Frontier needs to be at the Seed Vault for some reason they will stay within the office area. This area has not been used since the real workers were kicked out, but if need be will be there. The players are welcome to explore this area in order to try and find more information on what they might see moving forward. If the party is low level, then there will be no NPCs on this floor. If the party is higher level, then there will be some robot seed keepers on this floor  (see scene 7 for information on robot seed keepers).

If the players choose to explore the different offices on this floor, there are some useful things the players may find. Within these offices there will be Robot Assembly Blueprints, which show how the robot seed keepers and robot farmers are built and controlled. This could come in handy later on in the campaign. The players could also find a map of the Seed Vault, which could help the players make more informed decisions on their plan within the Seed Vault.
