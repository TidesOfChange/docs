Above the offices is a floor reserved for the laboratory. This lab was used to test and alter the genetic make-up of plant species. The players are welcome to explore this area in order to try and find more information on what they might see moving forward. If the party is low level, then there will be no NPCs on this floor. If the party is higher level, then there will be some robot seed keepers on this floor (see scene 7 for information on robot seed keepers).
Out in the open the players will be able to see information about the different plants that are grown in the green house. Should they choose to look through the laboratory drawers and the files in them, they will find the research that was done on the plants. This will break down for them which plants are helpful for healing. Only if players choose to look through all of the drawers in the office will they find seed information and the tools used to test and alter the plant species. This will be helpful when they are trying to locate the seeds in the seed library.
