After accepting their quest the players have time to plan their heist. There are different ways they can spend their time, and based on how they use it, the more information they can get to help them be successful. Players are not limited to only one option but they should use their time wisely as they need to break into the seed vault before MegaCorp sends more robot seed keepers to tighten up security. 

### Option 1: Talk to Elder Ernest Elderberry
Players will gain more insight into the information he has on the seed vault and how it functions.

### Option 2: Scope out the seed vault
Meet the Peter Periwinkle (see below)
If players scope out the seed vault they can see one of the drivers, Peter Periwinkle, leaving the vault to deliver goods to the village. They can follow him and try to gain information on how to enter the vault however they may or may not be successful in gaining information.
If players are successful in convincing Peter to help them they gain 10-20 XP.
Learn about the scanner by the garage door.
The players can choose to get close to the vault entrance where they can see a key pad. If they watch the drivers they will uncover that the door only opens when the correct credentials are presented at an electronic reader. To enter, a keycard with an embedded microchip is needed.

### Option 3: Meet Clara Chestnut (see below)
The players can seek out the chief seed keeper, Clara Chestnut, or they can cause trouble in the village and she will appear. She asks the players why they are in Grønn Verden and how she can help them. The players can question her for the information she has on the seed vault, but she is reluctant to give the information to them after the recent failed attempt. She is worried they will suffer the same fate and be caught by MegaCorp.

### Option 4: Resource Farming
The players can scavenge the area for any tools or weapons they believe will be useful in their quest. Resources are slim in Grønn Verden so players will need to be resourceful.

### NPCs
#### Clara Chestnut

**Background:** Chief Seed Keeper  
One of the original seed keepers who was hired by the MegaCorp. She is now the Chief Seed Keeper and runs the police force. She is extremely caring and always willing to lend a helping hand. She has intimate knowledge of the seed library but hasn’t interacted with any of the seed keeper robots.

**Species:** Squirrel

**Skills:**
- Leadership +10
- Force +10
- Bartering +10
- Insight +10
- Sneakiness +10

**Not allowed to help the players in their quest to save the seeds**

**Information she is allowed to give:**
- Knowledge on farmer robots
    - Clara knows how the farmer robots behave since she was still a seed keeper in the seed vault when they were first introduced. She did not interact with them regularly but knows they have a hostile side if you touch their plants which she made the mistake of doing. Therefore, she knows what you must do in order to disable the robot farmers (this knowledge is only helpful for the robot farmer, not the robot seed keepers).
- Seed library
    - Since Clara spent most of her time in the seed library she can describe it in detail. She knows how many seeds are kept in each drawer and the organizational system. The technology has updated since she last was in the seed library but she knows there is still a tablet used to identify where seeds are stored.
- Dangers
    - Clara can warn players about the dangers of trying to break into the seed vault. The robot farmers are extremely hostile when provoked so she can only imagine how dangerous the robot seed keepers are since they are programmed to be fighters and protect the seeds at all cost.

#### Peter Periwinkle

**Background:** Driver  
He was a seed keeper towards the end of the villagers working inside the seed vault. He was one of the few workers that was secretly kept and he is now a driver for MegaCorp. In the seed vault he is responsible for directing the farmer robots on how to load the produce from the greenhouse into the trucks and driving it to the surrounding villages.

**Species:** Chipmunk

**Skills:**
- Leadership +2
- Force +3 (For higher level players: +7)
- Bartering +1
- Insight +5
- Sneakiness +10

**Information he is allowed to give:**
- Farmer robots
    - Peter knows how the farmer robots behave since he works with them daily when directing them where to load the produce in his truck. He knows they have a hostile side if you touch their plants which he made the mistake of doing when he was first hired as a driver. Therefore, he knows what you must do in order to fight the robot farmers but he was never able to disable them (this knowledge is only helpful for the robot farmer, not the robot seed keepers).
- Basic information on the seed library
    - He was a low level seed keeper so he was not as involved in the seed library. He can still give basic information on where it is located, the general layout, and how seeds are filed.
- Information on how to get into the vault
    - Since he currently works at the seed vault he knows the garage door now has new technology where a keycard is needed to gain access. Only the drivers and MegaCorp have these keycards.
