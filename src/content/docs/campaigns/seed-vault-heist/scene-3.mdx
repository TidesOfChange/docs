The party needs to choose how they want to try to get into the vault. Depending on who they met and what they saw, the party has different options available to them.

### Option 1: Use Peter's Key Card
If the party met Peter Periwinkle and were successful in gaining his trust, they can use his key card to gain access into the vault.

### Option 2: Sneak in on Peter's Truck
If the players were unable to convince Peter to help them in their quest, they may choose to sneak in on his truck and hope they go unnoticed.

### Option 3: Sneak in Behind a Driver
If the players did not choose to scope out the seed vault before starting their quest, they will be unable to try to convince a driver to give them access. They can, however, try to sneak in behind a driver who uses their keycard to access the garage door.

### Option 4: Disable the Card Reader
The players can try to disable the card reader since the only access into the seed vault is through the garage door which requires a keycard for access. If players are successful in breaking into the vault on their own, they gain 5-10 XP.

After entering the vault, the players enter a large unloading dock with a set of stairs set to one corner. Here they encounter the robot farmers (see below) who are loading the trucks up with produce. The players must choose where to go from here as there are two directions they can choose. Based on what Ernest Elderberry told them, they can either choose to go up the stairs where the offices and greenhouse are or they can choose to go down the elevator directly to the seed library.

### NPCs
#### Semi-Hostile NPC: Robot Farmer

**Background:**  
These robots tend to the gardens and make sure the food grown within the vault is of the best quality they can make it. These robots will not pay attention to any other being within their area unless their crops are being messed with. If anyone who is not a farmer robot so much as even accidentally touches the crops, the farmer robot turns hostile towards them and them alone.

**Skills:**
- Reaction +8
- Force +2 (For higher level players: +6)
- Awareness +10
- Medicine +6
- Charm +1

These are non-verbal NPCs.
