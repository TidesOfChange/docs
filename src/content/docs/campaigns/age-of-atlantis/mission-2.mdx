### Description

A Celestial Dragon named Astralyss has been kidnapped by the evil scientists and hidden deep within their laboratory. They are experimenting on the Dragon to attempt to find out how to better harness Lux, but this is corrupting his magic in the same way that the Sludge Swamps would. In order to suppress the Celestial Dragon’s telepathic communication, they have placed Lux-enhanced metal chains around the Dragon.

To hear about the Celestial Dragon’s disappearance, the characters will have to have explored a certain area and heard from another character, such as Nerathis from Mission 1, or another character invented by the GM. The idea for this mission is that one of the Dragons has gone missing and is trapped in a laboratory inside Atlantis. To save the Dragon, the players will have to maneuver around the laboratory, and the scientists potentially having an altercation.

The first portion of this mission will be for the players to find their way into Atlantis. This might be easier if the cast of players is humans who are mostly from Atlantis, but otherwise it might be more difficult. They will also need to find out where the main scientist’s lab is, which they can do through exploring different locations within Atlantis.

### Upgrades

To make this portion of the mission more difficult, the characters could encounter ‘enforcers’ or other enemies along the way.

### Description

If the characters are successful in infiltrating the laboratory, they will also potentially be able to discover some of the larger secrets being kept by the scientists. In Dr. Umak’s office, they can find photos of the original council of scientists from 90 years ago where they look the same age as they do now— revealing that they have been using the Lux energy to prevent themselves from aging. They can also find maps with crosses that show where the scientists are searching for the reservoir.

In the cell where they are keeping the Celestial Dragon, the characters will have to find a way to trick or overcome the lab rat guarding the cell. Once inside, they will have to find a way to free the Celestial Dragon from its binds. Once freed, they will discover that the dragon will turn into an extra - powerful Murk Dweller. They will have to fight or run away from the Murk Dweller, or find a way to bring it to the reservoir and heal it.

Unfortunately, even if the players are successful, soon after leaving the lab, Astralyss will pass away.

### Upgrades

To make this portion of the mission more difficult, up the stats of the encountered characters or make it more challenging to navigate around the lab.

### Encountered characters

#### Lab rat

These are regular workers in the laboratory. They likely don’t know too much about the more sinister goals of the corporation (or don’t ask too many questions). They are overworked and over-caffeinated, so are unobservant and not very physically strong.
**Stats**

-   -2 Awareness
-   +4 Cybernetics
-   -1 Reaction

#### Dr. Umak

Dr. Umak is a head scientist of MegaCorp. He wears a Lux-infused necklace, which keeps him forever young and extra strong and fast. If the necklace is destroyed, however, he will revert back to his original age (over 100) and likely die. He is very smart and suspicious. He is not someone to mess around with and has plans to infiltrate the reservoir in order to steal more Lux to power his technology and the rest of Atlantis, as he knows their time is limited.
**Stats**

-   +5 Strength (without Lux necklace -1)
-   +5 Fear
-   +5 Deduction

#### Celestial Dragon (Astralyss)

The Celestial Dragon is a special class of Aqualumean. They are the chiefs of the Aqualumean villages. This one is pretty old (around 300), so he has seen the creation of Atlantis and is very knowledgeable about the lore. However, due to the experiments, Astralyss has turned into a Murk Dweller and is now very dangerous, as the Dragon was already many times more powerful than a normal Aqualumean. As a Murk Dweller, Astralyss would have more intelligence than a regular Murk Dweller and be able to fight effectively.
**Stats**

-   +4 Strength
-   +3 Insight
-   +5 Medicine
