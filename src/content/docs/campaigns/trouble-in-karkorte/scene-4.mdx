Following the route taken by the missing team, the signs of their survival grow increasingly grim. Along the way, your group sees traces of a fight—scattered equipment and the scent of blood linger in the water. As you swim further, a submarine emerges from the shadows. The promise of high-quality steel lures the party, but the area feels eerily dangerous. The group feels an oppressive presence, as if losing focus might cost them their sanity (*Roll d20 to resist mind control for a turn*). 

A deep growl echoes from the submarine, forcing the group to decide whether to:
1. **Pursue the resources inside the submarine.**
2. **Retreat to avoid potential disaster.**
