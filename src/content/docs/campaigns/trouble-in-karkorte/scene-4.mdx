While following the same route the previous team took, the signs of them being alive are looking less and less. Along the route your group sees traces of a fight. The scent of blood lurks around the area and there is scattered equipment everywhere. When swimming further ahead your group approaches a submarine. The submarine promises high quality steel, but the area around is eerie. Your group feels like if they lose focus they would lose their minds (roll Affinity to see if they resist getting mind controlled for a round). To add on there is a deep growl echoing out of the submarine.

Your group is faced with a choice:

1. Pursue the resources in the submarine
2. Go back home empty handed

Either way it is a far way back and there is danger heading back concerning ambushes.

## Monster

### **Boss Monster: Tiger “Shark”**

-   Health: 12
-   Agility: 3
-   Attack: 3 damage
-   Passive: On a crit the target bleeds and takes one additional harm per round
-   **Rewards:** 25 XP, tiger shark canines, tiger shark meat

---

## Ambush

If the party decides to not fight the boss monster in the submarine and decides to head back, they don’t get the loot from the environment.
The upside is that the party won’t have to do a check in order to resist mind control. Downside is that the tiger shark gets a **+2 to all attacks** and gets first move.
Afterwards the group is still able to explore the current environment before heading back to the city.

### Scenario 1: Direct Confrontation

If the party defeats the tiger shark:

-   The party loots the environment for steel and scavenger team gear. Victorious, they leave to return home.

---

### Scenario 2: Ambushed

If the party avoids fighting the tiger shark and retreats:

-   The tiger shark gains a **+1 damage buff** and **first move** in combat.
-   The party is forced to retreat with minimal loot, carrying only what they brought with them.
