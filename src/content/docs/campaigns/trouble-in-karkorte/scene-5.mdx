Heading back to Karkorte the group was met with damning news, activity at the nuclear power plant has increased and it now poses a danger to the whole area around. The group has been forced to clear out this power plant by themselves. The fate of the town rests on your party’s shoulders. 

### Description
As your group approaches the power plant, you all feel like something's off. It feels sickening, the water around is thicker to swim through, the radiation makes your skin tingle and burn. Then you hear a loud roar from deep in the power plant. Dread fills all your souls.
