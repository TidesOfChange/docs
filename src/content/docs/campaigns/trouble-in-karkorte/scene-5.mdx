Returning to Karkorte, the group is met with grim news—activity at the nuclear power plant has increased, posing a dire threat to the surrounding area. The group must clear the plant of danger to secure the town’s survival. 

### Description
As the group approaches the power plant, a suffocating feeling sets in. The water grows thicker, radiation burns the skin, and an unsettling roar echoes through the structure. Tension builds as the group faces an eldritch monster lurking in the plant’s depths.
