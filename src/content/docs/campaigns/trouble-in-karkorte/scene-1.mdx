## Read To Players

Food has always been scarce in Karkorte and the town has been slowly deteriorating. With increasing amounts of refugees, food has also become evermore scarce. Morale is running low and everyone is yearning for an end to tough times. In this dark time, the government has recently decided to implement a lottery system to pick citizens and refugees to go out to gather food. You all have been selected by the lottery system to venture beyond the bubble. 

The team meets near the edge of the bubble to discuss the delegation of certain tasks and your individual skills. (Roleplay introductions) After introductions, your team was given a week worth of rations and basic equipment (includes breathing apparatus). On the way outside of the edge of the bubble the group hears “HEY” from behind them. As they look around a fit young Karkortian named Gerald approaches them. Gerald says “Y’all have two options: go towards the abandoned town or to take the safer route to the abyssal plains. If I were y’all I would choose to go to the abyssal plains, unless you aren’t afraid to die. If you still want to go, prove it and show me that yall got what it takes”
