Walking along the worn-down roads, your group walks past a worn-down sign that is barely legible. Yâ€™all are able to make out the words *(N~w Jerse~y)*. As the group swims closer to the town, the radiation gets stronger. The effects of the radiation cause the group to become more nauseous (*-1 to Agility and Intuition*). 

As the group walks around the town, they see an abundant amount of metal and small ocean life. However, the deeper you all walk into the town the more you all feel like you are getting watched by something. Walking more inwards also brings in more frequent attacks, but brings in more valuable materials.

**Aftermath:**  
Once finished, the group returns to town to deliver the materials gathered. The group is informed of another team that went north in search of valuable resources and has not returned. The party is sent to investigate their disappearance.
