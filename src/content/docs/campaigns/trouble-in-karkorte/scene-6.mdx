Upon returning to Karkorte the party is met with the Gerald running into the bubble really hurt. He looks up to the party and tells about the horrors that are going to happen to the city. The eldritch god has revived and is amassing monsters to invade Karkorte. 

Here the party can use the resources to reinforce the city and prepare for the invasion. The party would then be responsible for taking care of the eldritch god. Upon success peace would befall the city, upon failure the city falls to ruin.
