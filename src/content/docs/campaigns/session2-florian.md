# Session 2: Florians  
<span style="color:green;">(Note Green = GM only text) </span>

## Story Setup  
The party enters a fragmented society of elite, snobby flowers who are constantly in debate with one another in order to garner more political power. While here, the party realizes that the society of Florians is even more deeply divided between the topic of AI; whether it is a tool of evil and destruction, or something that can help improve their ways of life. The more radical party demands complete and utter destruction of AI, whereas the more moderate society figure headed by Dan D. Lion is supportive of the defense of the Ecotopia, but refuses to join forces with the radical party. As it remains, the Ecotopia will never be able to defend itself without both Florian factions uniting together, at least temporarily, in order to fight off the AI invasion.

## Task 1: Debate Badge  

### Context  
Florian society highly values intelligence and persuasion. This is shown in their tendency to debate one another in regards to nearly anything and everything. However, not just any Florian citizen can address the public on the mainstage; they must prove that their debate skills are worthy to be heard by the greater public. Any Florian that has proven their intellect and public speaking wear what is known as a “Debate Badge:” a golden scroll, on the collars of their shirts, armor, or robes. These figures are more highly respected throughout Florian society, and at any point are able to grab a podium while a debate is in session. This is how Florian elections are decided and how major public decisions are made: Dan D. Lion’s election is particularly famous within Florian society for being a complete landslide victory, a feat he is extremely proud of.  

The player party needs to obtain a badge for each member in order to participate in a Florian debate, with the goal of convincing the two parties to unite. There are multiple ways in which the party can achieve this:  

- **Stealth and thievery**: obtaining a badge by sneaking into the Florian Debate Society and stealing their badges.  
- **Persuasion**: the party joins the Florian Debate Society and debates an elder Florian, proving their worth to wear the badge.  
- **Physical task**: the party meets with a ‘rogue’ elder Florian who realizes the risks of the AI invasion and issues that the separation between Florian society brings to the defense of the Ecotopia. He is willing to give them counterfeit badges and write them into the Florian Debate Logs, proving their legitimacy, if the party clears out a cellar with enemies.  

### <span style="color:green;">GM NOTE  </span>
<span style="color:green;"> While any party can attempt any of these three arcs, it is wise to lean the group more towards one that they are more prone to succeeding at. For example, a party without a thief/rogue character would greatly struggle at the stealth and thievery arc.  </span>

---

### **Stealth and Thievery Arc**  

The party can sneak into the Florian Debate Society by various means. Their ultimate goal is to find the vault with countless Debate Badges, which is guarded by security cameras, motion detectors, soldiers, and more. The difficulty of this section can be scaled in accordance to the levels of the group members, especially their stealth skills.  

#### Layout  
The layout of the Florian Debate Society features:  
- A massive stage with countless rows of benches for spectators on all sides.  
- To the right of the main door: stairs leading to the upstairs section, with balconies for more audience members to watch any debates taking place.  
- To the left: stairs leading downstairs; this section is completely blocked off to the public, as only the most important members of the Florian Debate Society can enter. Within this section are offices, a massive library filled with books new and old, and a sealed off vault.  

#### Challenges  
- The party can crack into the vault using any sort of technology/weapons they might have that are capable of the task, but there should also be a kind of vent or another way that a stealth/small character can enter through. (This vent should only be made apparent after perception checks.)  
- <span style="color:green;">Florian society denotes who obtains a Debate Badge within the Florian Debate Ledger. If the party is unaware of this prior, or cannot pass an intuition check on the way out if they spot the Ledger, their ability to pass the debate task will be much more difficult.  </span>
- <span style="color:green;"> If they are spotted during the theft, their mission should not be made impossible, however, it will be much more difficult and need to pivot to the persuasion/combat arcs in order to prove themselves to greater Florian society.  </span>

### **Persuasion Arc**  

The party will need to enter the Florian Debate Society, meet with an Elder Florian, and prove their ability to debate and persuade in order to earn a Debate Badge.  

#### Persuasion Checks  
1. **Persuasion Check 1**: Convince the Elder Florian that they are skilled enough to join the Florian Debate Society. Party can decide to do this in any way they choose.  
2. **Persuasion Check 2**: Debate with another Florian Debate Society (FDS) student. The FDS serves as a school for Florians to gain debating skills; students commonly train together by debating one another. The party is approached by an arrogant Florian who believes that the party is unworthy of the Debate Society, and asks why they are trying. The party, preferably, must convince the Florian through explaining to him the chaos between the Arborians and AI, and the threat it currently imposes to the rest of the Ecotopia. After passing this argument, the Elder Florian recognizes their skill as debaters, and takes them to the High Arguer.  
3. **Persuasion Check 3**: Pass their final test by debating the High Arguer, the most efficient and renowned debater in Florian society. He has sworn off any sort of political power, seeking purely to expand the knowledge of young Florians in arguments and debates. The party can pass this exam and take it in any direction, however, the High Arguer is most interested in topics of cyborgs, the AI invasion, and possible reconciliation with the Arborians and Mycelians.  

Upon passing this debate, the party can obtain their Debate Badges.

### **Physical Task Arc**  

Whilst at a bar preparing their next moves, a ‘rogue’ elder Florian approaches the party, and questions why a rag-tag group are in the Ecotopia. They explain the situation with the Arborians, and the elder Florian is oddly receptive; he explains his reservations about the division between Florian society, and clearly disagrees with it, and is very supportive of the Arborian cause.  

#### Task  
<span style="color:green;"> The elder Florian explains to the party the Debate Badges, and that they would be unable to debate the greater Florian society without them. The elder Florian states he would be able to give them their Debate Badges and make them official within the Florian Debate Society, however, needs them to complete a combat task prior.  </span> 

<span style="color:green;"> The party must recover ancient texts stolen by bandits from the Florian Debate Society library.   </span>

<span style="color:green;"> The levels of bandits, their weapons, and experience with these guns increase in accordance to the party’s levels:  </span>
- <span style="color:green;">**Level 1**: Leather armor, swords, bows and arrows.  </span>
- <span style="color:green;">**Level 2**: Metal armor, makeshift guns.  </span>
- <span style="color:green;">**Level 3**: Cyborg-enhanced armor, laser weapons.  </span>
- <span style="color:green;">**Level 4+**: Advanced cyborg armor and weapons, near AI-level proficiency.  </span>

Upon recovering the texts, the elder provides the badges and legitimizes the party in the Florian Debate Society.  </span>

---

## Task 2: Debate  

After obtaining their Debate Badges, the party must join a Florian debate night and argue the extremity of the impending cyborg invasion. The party must unite the Florians with the ‘radical’ party, finding a common ground between the two.  

### <span style="color:green;"> GM Note  </span>
- <span style="color:green;">The party should have increased difficulty if they were caught during the stealth and thievery arc, but obtained the badges elsewhere. </span> 
- <span style="color:green;">If they succeeded, but didn’t sign the Florian Debate Ledger, a Debate Official should raise this to the audience’s attention. The party must pass a persuasion check - if they fail, their ability to pass the debate should be made much harder. </span> 

---

## Boss: Dan D. Lion  

### The Final Debate  
After successfully passing the debate and persuading the greater Florian public to their cause, Dan D. Lion reveals himself and enters the debate stage. The party must now successfully debate Dan D. Lion, in front of the audience, and persuade him to accept joining forces with the radical party.  

Dan D. Lion initially ran on a political campaign of being highly against the fringe Florian group. The party will have to convince Dan D. Lion otherwise by showing him the risks that the cyborg invasion has on the Ecotopia.  

### <span style="color:green;"> GM Note  </span>
<span style="color:green;"> If a member of the party is exceptionally skilled in persuasion, or the group has had abnormally good skill checks in regards to persuasion, then Dan D. Lion should be extraordinarily impressed at their abilities, relating to his landslide victory in his debates. Although the group shouldn’t be handed a victory, it should be made easier, and skill checks should reflect this.  </span>
