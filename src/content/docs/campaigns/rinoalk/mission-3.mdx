### Mission 3: Night of the Turtius’

Location: Rinoalkian Seawall Border

Description:
 As the storm passes, an eerie silence settles over the coast, that is until a distant, vivid screech breaks the calm. The Turtius’, bioluminescent and twisted by long-term exposure to radiation, begin emerging from the distant waters. The storm has disturbed their nesting grounds, and now they swarm toward the Rinoalkian coast in search of food. The players must work together to fortify their position, repel the terrifying creatures, and uncover the origins of the radiation before their city is overrun.

Objectives:
- Defend the encampment until the storm fully subsides.
- Prevent the infection—if bitten, players may start experiencing mutations.
- Optional: Capture a live Turtius for study.

Encountered Characters:
Turtius’ (Hostile Creature - Swarm Behavior) [NPC]
- Description: Mutated, eel-like quadrupeds with slick, iridescent skin. Their elongated jaws house needle-like teeth, and their tails are tipped with bioluminescent barbs capable of delivering a venomous sting. 
- Abilities:
    - Swarm Tactics: Attacks become deadlier when multiple Turtius’ are in close proximity.
    - Bioluminescent Lure: Can emit hypnotic flashes to disorient prey.
    - Venomous Bite: Causes temporary paralysis if untreated.
