## Mission 1

:::note[Location]
Lumea - Sludge Swamps
:::

### Description

An Aqualumean village child (Nerathis) has wandered out into the Sludge Swamps chasing after his pet fish. As a result, Nerathis becomes corrupted by both the magic and the natural pollution, turning into a Murk Dweller. His family is determined to cure him, and so that is the mission of the players! When searching for Nerathis the players may encounter different obstacles, such as mutated animals and other Murk Dwellers.

### Upgrades

For more advanced players, increase the amount of Murk Dwellers encountered in the Sludge Swamps while trying to save Nerathis or increase the danger of the mutated animal encountered.

### Encountered Characters

#### Murk Dweller NPC
One of the corrupted Aqualumeans who has been exposed to the pollution of the Sludge Swamps.
- See species section for more.
- Stats:
    - Awareness: -2
    - Force: +3
    - Swimming: +3

#### Nerathis
The lost Aqualumean child, aged 7 years.

Stats are same as a Murk Dweller NPC when he is in his Murk Dweller state, except for only +2 in Force and Swimming due to his smaller size.

#### Mutated animal
This could be any marine animal, such as a shark or turtle, that has become corrupted by the pollution, causing them to become violent and angry.
- They are not as dangerous as Murk Dwellers, but can still pose a challenge to those entering the Sludge Swamps.
- Stats are up to the GM.

## Mission 2

:::note[Location]
The Reservoir
:::

## Description
Once Nerathis has been found, the players must find a way to enter the reservoir. If the players are mostly made up of Aqualumean characters, they must find the Celestial Dragon and simply ask for Nerathis’ entry to the reservoir. However, if the players are not Aqualumeans, they must make some kind of trade with the village Aqualumeans to find a Celestial Dragon and gain entry. Once they are inside, they are able to place Nerathis into the center of the reservoir for the Lux to heal him from the magical corruption of the Sludge Swamps. During this process, it will become revealed that Nerathis is actually a Celestial Dragon– the magic will swirl around him and mark him as being chosen for the position. This has a few implications, as there are only four Celestial Dragons, so if Nerathis has been chosen as one, it could mean something has happened to another one. Being a Celestial Dragon means that Nerathis will become an important spiritual member of his community. However, he will still not be able to be cured completely from the corruption of the Sludge Swamps as the natural pollution has given him physical diseases that human technology is necessary to cure. For now, he will still not be able to speak and will be very weak, although he will no longer be violent like a Murk Dweller.

### Upgrades

None for this area of the mission.

### Encountered Characters

#### Celestial Dragon (Solvessa)
Solvessa is one of the celestial dragons and takes her role very seriously. She makes sure to protect the reservoir at all costs, and as a result might sometimes be too strict about letting people in, even when it is necessary to heal a Murk Dweller.
- Stats:
    - Strength: +3
    - Insight: +4
    - Medicine: +5

#### Regular village Aqualumean NPC
She is very suspicious of humans after seeing the harm that Atlantis has caused her community. She might consider connecting the players with a Celestial Dragon in exchange for information about human technology or Atlantis’ weaknesses. It is also possible to appeal to her empathetic nature, although it must be completely sincere. It is also possible to trade technology.
- Stats:
    - Strength: +3
    - Agility: +2
    - Swimming: +3
    - HP: +7
    - Mechanics and Cybernetics: -3


## Mission 3

:::note[Location]
Atlantis
:::

### Description
As Nerathis needs human medicine to heal him, the players must take him to Atlantis. If the players are mostly made up of human characters, they might have their own connections / backstory to Atlantis and be able to enter that way. If the characters are mostly Aqualumean or another species, they will need to find another way to get inside, such as befriending a human to open the entrance for them or using their unique skills / abilities to break in. The objective is to purchase or steal medicine from a pharmacy, depending on what the players choose. Once Nerathis becomes well enough from the medicine, he will share information with the players that he was playing with his pet fish when he heard a message from a Celestial Dragon that needed help, but was quickly cut off. He thinks that the humans took the missing Celestial Dragon (Astralyss) and are keeping him somewhere in Atlantis.

### Upgrades
To make this portion of the mission more difficult, the characters could encounter ‘enforcers’ or other enemies that might not want them to enter Atlantis.


### Encountered characters
#### Pharmacist
He will not be happy to see Aqualumeans or suspicious characters in his shop. 
- Stats
    - Medicine +3
    - Bartering +3
