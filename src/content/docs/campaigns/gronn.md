## Summary
An unlikely group of strangers is brought to Grønn Verden because of the stories they’ve been told about this luscious land. However, when they arrive they find the exact opposite. Trying to make the most out of their long journeys they find themselves participating in the town traditions and listening to the tales of one of the village elders when unexpectedly they are tasked with a mission. The fate of Grønn Verden now lies in the hands of these strangers. Will they be able to restore biodiversity in Grønn Verden? There’s only one way to find out…

## Scene 1: Adventure Begins
The players have traveled far and wide and have now arrived in Grønn Verden. It’s their first night and they have gathered around the communal campfire in the center of the village to hear the stories of the Elders. Elder Ernest Elderberry (see below) approaches the newcomers and asks them what brought them to Grønn Verden. 

The next day, the players run into Ernest who is visibly distressed. He starts telling the players about his troubles. He sent a group of adventurers into the seed vault to steal seeds for the village, and he just got word they were caught by MegaCorp. He doesn’t know if they were successful in reaching the seed library or what they found on the inside. 

Eventually, Ernest asks the players if they can help him. He needs them to get the seeds from the seed vault to bring back a thriving farming community and restore biodiversity in Grønn Verden. The seeds he specifically needs are: Peas, Wheat, Corn, Rice, Beans, and Squash. 

## Ernest Elderberry

**Background:** Village Elder  
One of the original farmers who was hired by the company. After being fired from the seed vault he wrote down all his knowledge on his seeds. He now tells the village people his stories to keep the magic of his seeds alive in the younger generations. He is widely regarded by the people of Grønn Verden and has intimate knowledge of the seed vault but hasn’t interacted with any of the robots.

**Species:** Bunny

**Skills:**
- Medicine +10
- Foraging +10
- Reaction +10
- Sneakiness +10
- Deduction +10

**Not allowed to help the players in their quest to save the seeds**

**Information he is allowed to give:**
- Knowledge on seed vault
    - Ernest knows the entire layout of the seed vault and can describe in detail where each of the staircases lead (see map below)
    - He cannot provide a physical map only a description
    - He is also to tell players how they must enter the seed vault
        - There is only one access point which is the garage door
        - The technology on the door has been updated since he was employed. He is unsure what is needed to gain access through the door.
- He can give players background information on MegaCorp.
    - They are an evil corporation that initially was using the seed vault as a solution to biodiversity loss then realized they could make a profit from the lack of seeds on the outside. They were not always evil but capitalism corrupted their values.

## Scene 2: Quest Preparation
After accepting their quest the players have time to plan their heist. There are different ways they can spend their time, and based on how they use it, the more information they can get to help them be successful. Players are not limited to only one option but they should use their time wisely as they need to break into the seed vault before MegaCorp sends more robot seed keepers to tighten up security. 

### Option 1: Talk to Elder Ernest Elderberry
Players will gain more insight into the information he has on the seed vault and how it functions.

### Option 2: Scope out the seed vault
Meet the Peter Periwinkle (see below)
If players scope out the seed vault they can see one of the drivers, Peter Periwinkle, leaving the vault to deliver goods to the village. They can follow him and try to gain information on how to enter the vault however they may or may not be successful in gaining information.
If players are successful in convincing Peter to help them they gain 10-20 XP.
Learn about the scanner by the garage door.
The players can choose to get close to the vault entrance where they can see a key pad. If they watch the drivers they will uncover that the door only opens when the correct credentials are presented at an electronic reader. To enter, a keycard with an embedded microchip is needed.

### Option 3: Meet Clara Chestnut (see below)
The players can seek out the chief seed keeper, Clara Chestnut, or they can cause trouble in the village and she will appear. She asks the players why they are in Grønn Verden and how she can help them. The players can question her for the information she has on the seed vault, but she is reluctant to give the information to them after the recent failed attempt. She is worried they will suffer the same fate and be caught by MegaCorp.

### Option 4: Resource Farming
The players can scavenge the area for any tools or weapons they believe will be useful in their quest. Resources are slim in Grønn Verden so players will need to be resourceful.

### NPCs
#### Clara Chestnut

**Background:** Chief Seed Keeper  
One of the original seed keepers who was hired by the MegaCorp. She is now the Chief Seed Keeper and runs the police force. She is extremely caring and always willing to lend a helping hand. She has intimate knowledge of the seed library but hasn’t interacted with any of the seed keeper robots.

**Species:** Squirrel

**Skills:**
- Leadership +10
- Force +10
- Bartering +10
- Insight +10
- Sneakiness +10

**Not allowed to help the players in their quest to save the seeds**

**Information she is allowed to give:**
- Knowledge on farmer robots
    - Clara knows how the farmer robots behave since she was still a seed keeper in the seed vault when they were first introduced. She did not interact with them regularly but knows they have a hostile side if you touch their plants which she made the mistake of doing. Therefore, she knows what you must do in order to disable the robot farmers (this knowledge is only helpful for the robot farmer, not the robot seed keepers).
- Seed library
    - Since Clara spent most of her time in the seed library she can describe it in detail. She knows how many seeds are kept in each drawer and the organizational system. The technology has updated since she last was in the seed library but she knows there is still a tablet used to identify where seeds are stored.
- Dangers
    - Clara can warn players about the dangers of trying to break into the seed vault. The robot farmers are extremely hostile when provoked so she can only imagine how dangerous the robot seed keepers are since they are programmed to be fighters and protect the seeds at all cost.

#### Peter Periwinkle

**Background:** Driver  
He was a seed keeper towards the end of the villagers working inside the seed vault. He was one of the few workers that was secretly kept and he is now a driver for MegaCorp. In the seed vault he is responsible for directing the farmer robots on how to load the produce from the greenhouse into the trucks and driving it to the surrounding villages.

**Species:** Chipmunk

**Skills:**
- Leadership +2
- Force +3 (For higher level players: +7)
- Bartering +1
- Insight +5
- Sneakiness +10

**Information he is allowed to give:**
- Farmer robots
    - Peter knows how the farmer robots behave since he works with them daily when directing them where to load the produce in his truck. He knows they have a hostile side if you touch their plants which he made the mistake of doing when he was first hired as a driver. Therefore, he knows what you must do in order to fight the robot farmers but he was never able to disable them (this knowledge is only helpful for the robot farmer, not the robot seed keepers).
- Basic information on the seed library
    - He was a low level seed keeper so he was not as involved in the seed library. He can still give basic information on where it is located, the general layout, and how seeds are filed.
- Information on how to get into the vault
    - Since he currently works at the seed vault he knows the garage door now has new technology where a keycard is needed to gain access. Only the drivers and MegaCorp have these keycards.

## Scene 3: Break into the Vault 
The party needs to choose how they want to try to get into the vault. Depending on who they met and what they saw, the party has different options available to them.

### Option 1: Use Peter's Key Card
If the party met Peter Periwinkle and were successful in gaining his trust, they can use his key card to gain access into the vault.

### Option 2: Sneak in on Peter's Truck
If the players were unable to convince Peter to help them in their quest, they may choose to sneak in on his truck and hope they go unnoticed.

### Option 3: Sneak in Behind a Driver
If the players did not choose to scope out the seed vault before starting their quest, they will be unable to try to convince a driver to give them access. They can, however, try to sneak in behind a driver who uses their keycard to access the garage door.

### Option 4: Disable the Card Reader
The players can try to disable the card reader since the only access into the seed vault is through the garage door which requires a keycard for access. If players are successful in breaking into the vault on their own, they gain 5-10 XP.

After entering the vault, the players enter a large unloading dock with a set of stairs set to one corner. Here they encounter the robot farmers (see below) who are loading the trucks up with produce. The players must choose where to go from here as there are two directions they can choose. Based on what Ernest Elderberry told them, they can either choose to go up the stairs where the offices and greenhouse are or they can choose to go down the elevator directly to the seed library.

### NPCs
#### Semi-Hostile NPC: Robot Farmer

**Background:**  
These robots tend to the gardens and make sure the food grown within the vault is of the best quality they can make it. These robots will not pay attention to any other being within their area unless their crops are being messed with. If anyone who is not a farmer robot so much as even accidentally touches the crops, the farmer robot turns hostile towards them and them alone.

**Skills:**
- Reaction +8
- Force +2 (For higher level players: +6)
- Awareness +10
- Medicine +6
- Charm +1

These are non-verbal NPCs.

## Scene 4: Explore the Office
The stairs from the unloading dock lead to the middle section of the building where the layout is made up of long hallways with old dorms and offices that are now unused. If anyone from MegaCorp needs to be at the seed vault for some reason they will stay within the office area. This area has not been used since the real workers were kicked out, but if need be will be there. The players are welcome to explore this area in order to try and find more information on what they might see moving forward. If the party is level 4-, then there will be no npcs on this floor. If the party is level 5+, then there will be some robot seed keepers on this floor  (see scene 7 for information on robot seed keepers).
If the players choose to explore the different offices on this floor, there are some useful things the players may find. Within these offices there will be Robot Assembly Blueprints, which show how the robot seed keepers and robot farmers are built and controlled. This could come in handy later on in the campaign. The players could also find a map of the seed vault, which could help the players make more informed decisions on their plan within the seed vault.

## Scene 5: Explore the Lab 
Above the offices is a floor reserved for the laboratory. This lab was used to test and alter the genetic make-up of plant species. The players are welcome to explore this area in order to try and find more information on what they might see moving forward. If the party is level 4-, then there will be no NPCs on this floor. If the party is level 5+, then there will be some robot seed keepers on this floor (see scene 7 for information on robot seed keepers).
Out in the open the players will be able to see information about the different plants that are grown in the green house. Should they choose to look through the laboratory drawers and the files in them, they will find the research that was done on the plants. This will break down for them which plants are helpful for healing. Only if players choose to look through all of the drawers in the office will they find seed information and the tools used to test and alter the plant species. This will be helpful when they are trying to locate the seeds in the seed library.

## Scene 6: Explore the Greenhouse 
Above the laboratory is the roof of the seed vault. It is made of reflective glass and acts as a greenhouse. The greenhouse is used to grow some of the species of plants as food. Here MegaCorp grows everything from cabbage to corn. The plants are grown and tended by the robot farmers. The players are welcome to explore this area to learn information that can help them in the seed library. All of the plants are labeled with their scientific name (for higher level players they will need to remember this information for the seed vault). They will be able to see all of the grown versions of the seeds Ernest Elderberry tasked them with finding. Taking the plants alone is not enough to complete Ernest’s request, however. The players must get the seeds from the seed vault. 


### Scientific Names of Seeds
- Peas --> *Pisum sativum*
- Wheat --> *Triticum*
- Corn --> *Zea mays*
- Rice --> *Oryza sativa*
- Beans --> *Phaseolus vulgaris*
- Squash --> *Cucurbita*

If the players looked through the laboratory drawers and found the old research on which plants help with healing, they can use this knowledge to find these specific plants in the greenhouse. If they choose to take some of these plants in preparation for their heist, they will face off with the farmer robots. If players are successful in fighting off the farmer robots, they will gain 10-20 XP.


## Scene 7: Steal the Seeds from the Seed Library
The storage of the seeds is below ground which is accessed by an elevator that descends into the ground. By traveling downwards, the temperature turns cooler so that the seeds can be refrigerated without using any power. This underground vault contains a library of seeds where each species is stored in a filing system composed of mobile shelving units. The location of each seed can be looked up using an electronic look-up table which is accessed by a tablet mounted on the wall. Each entry in the library contains a vial of the seeds for that species and each vial contains approximately 500 seeds. The size of the lower section is about half a square mile and contains seeds from about 100,000 species of phanerogams (a plant that produces seeds).

When they first enter the room, they see a nice reception area with tablets on the wall. These tablets are what the party can use to look up where in the vault the seeds they need are. This area is blocked off from the rest of the vault behind a large door. The players are welcome to choose to look up where the seeds they need are located within the vault on any of the tablets along the wall. (For parties level 5+ they will need to look up the scientific name for the plants found in the lab section of the vault).

Once entered into the seed library they will need to be careful to avoid the robot seed keepers (see below) stalking the hallways of the library. If the party had found the robot assembly blueprints from the office they are able to use that knowledge to attempt to peacefully disable the robots. The players can now find all the seeds they have been tasked to find from Elder Elderberry. The seeds have been spread out to different areas of the vault, but if the players chose to look up their locations it will be easier for them to find each objective.

As the players collect the seeds they should encounter more and more seed keepers as they are aware that seeds are starting to go missing. This will become more and more noticeable as the players get closer to collecting all of the seeds.

### NPCs
#### Hostile NPC: Robot Seed Keeper

**Background:**  
These robots stalk the aisles of the seed library to keep the seeds safe and stored properly. If they see any intruders, they will attack with blunt force in order to keep them safe.

**Damage:**
- For lower level players: 1d6
- For higher level players: 4d6

**Skills:**
- Reaction +5
- Force +5 (For higher level players: +8)
- Awareness +6 (For higher level players: +8)
- Deduction +4
- Fear +1

These are non-verbal NPCs.

## Scene 8: Escape without Getting Caught
After collecting all of the seeds from the library, all of the robot seed keepers will be made aware that the players have stolen many types of seeds from them. This will cause them to come to the players from seemingly nowhere. It is now that the players need to escape from the seed library and leave the vault as quickly as possible. The players only choice of escape route is the same way they entered the facility, so up into the loading dock and out into the outside world to deliver the seeds to people waiting in the village.
