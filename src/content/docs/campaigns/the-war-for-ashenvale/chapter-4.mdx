## CHAPTER 4: THE HEART OF CORRUPTION

### Read to Party:

Beyond the deep woods, the true horror of Ashenvale reveals itself. Towering trees twist around each other, their trunks pulsing with sickly, green light. The ground bubbles with toxic sludge, and the air is filled with thick, choking mist. Fungal growths pulse and glow, their spores drifting like pale, deadly snowflakes.

In the distance, the shattered remains of an ancient temple rise above the twisted forest. A structure that predates even the corruption, its walls crawling with glowing vines.

### Party Options

#### _Option 1: Explore the Ruined Temple_

If the party succeeds, they discover ancient texts and a map of Ashenvale’s corrupted regions. This knowledge grants a +2 bonus on navigation checks in future chapters.

If the party fails, they trigger a collapse, causing each member taking 5 HP in falling damage.

#### _Option 2: Attempt to Purify a Corrupted Grove_

If the party succeeds, they channel their strength, burning away the corruption in a small area, gaining a Blessing of Resistance (+1 to all saving throws until the next chapter).

If the party fails, the corruption lashes out, dealing 6 HP poison damage to each party member.

#### _Option 3: Search for Powerful Relics_

If the party succeeds, they find a corrupted artifact, a shard of crystallized energy. It can be used as a one-time powerful spell (+5 to any spell or attack roll).

If the party fails, the artifact shatters, releasing a toxic cloud (5 HP poison damage).

### Story Path

If the party succeeds in the temple, they gain knowledge of a hidden path to an ancient fortress. Frontier’s lost facility.

If they purify the grove, they gain protection against corruption’s effects.

_Regardless of their choices, they must continue deeper into Ashenvale._
