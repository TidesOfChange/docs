A Dark Fantasy TRPG Campaign (2-3 Sessions)

 🎭 Genre: Dark Fantasy, Post-Apocalyptic Warfare

🎲 Core Mechanics: How the Dice Work
This campaign follows a D20-based rolling system for all encounters. The GM sets the Difficulty Class (DC) for each action:
🟢 Success: Rolling equal to or above the DC means the action succeeds.
🟡 Partial Success: Rolling slightly below (1-3 points lower) means a limited success (players make progress but with setbacks).
🔴 Failure: Rolling 4+ points below means the action fails, leading to consequences.
💀 Critical Failure (Nat 1): A natural 1 always fails, with extra consequences.
🔥 Critical Success (Nat 20): A natural 20 always succeeds, often with bonus effects.
