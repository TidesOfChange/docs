## Chapter 3: THE DEEP WOODS OF ASHENVALE
### Read to Party:
The forest grows darker, the trees twisting overhead to blot out the sickly sky. The air is thick, heavy with a damp, rotting smell. Strange shapes loom in the mist… gnarled roots that almost seem to move, shadows that linger even when you turn away. In the distance, you hear the groan of dying trees and the faint, unnatural whispering of the corrupted land.
The path splits, one trail leads through a dense thicket, where the mist is thickest and the sounds of unseen creatures are loudest. The other is a narrow, rocky path along a cliffside, where gusts of foul wind howl like dying voices.

### Party Options

#### <I>Option 1: Brave the Misty Thicket </I>
If the party succeeds, they will carefully navigate through the mist, catching sight of corrupted wildlife before it ambushes the group. They manage to avoid conflict.

If the party fails, they are attacked by twisted forest beasts, warped deer with fungal growths or venomous, vine-covered serpents.

#### <I>Option 2: Navigate the Cliffside Path </I>
If the party succeeds, they cling to the jagged rocks, avoiding the toxic wind’s force. They reach the far side safely.

If the party fails, the wind tears at them, and they lose their grip, each player taking **5 HP** of falling damage before they scramble to safety.

#### <I>Option 3: Search for a Hidden Path </I>

If the party succeeds, they will discover an ancient, overgrown trail, forgotten and untouched. It leads you to a hidden glade, a brief sanctuary from corruption.

If the party fails, the search leads them into a patch of toxic spores, causing each player to suffer **3 HP** in poison damage.

### Story Path
If the party chooses the Misty Thicket, they reach a twisted glade with strange, half-living statues, a place of eerie calm but hidden danger.

If they take the Cliffside Path, they discover an ancient, ruined watchtower overlooking the poisoned forest.

If they find the Hidden Path, they stumble upon a sacred grove, a place where corruption seems to struggle against a dying force of purity.

Regardless of the choice, their journey will eventually converge toward _Chapter 4: The Heart of Corruption_.
