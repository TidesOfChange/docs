## CHAPTER 1: ASHENVALE’S CHOICE

### Read To Party:

Ashenvale is a dying land, an expanse of twisted trees, poison-choked rivers, and skies that churn with toxic storms. Once a lush paradise, the forest has become a place where the earth bleeds, and the air tastes of ash. Decades of unchecked corruption have left it scarred, its beauty twisted into a grotesque parody of life.

You have barely escaped the collapse of your homeland, a desperate flight through collapsing tunnels and toxic waters. Now you stand on the shores of Ashenvale, a place where even the light seems sickly, filtered through a sky tainted by acidic mist.

But you are not alone!

The forest shifts, and shapes emerge. Warriors in patchwork armor, their faces hidden behind twisted, organic masks. These are the Apomonosis, the survivors of Ashenvale who have lived in the heart of this poisoned land and have become something else to endure its horrors.

"Outsiders! This is Apomonosis territory! Surrender, or be eliminated!" one of them shouts, raising a crude, toxin-stained spear.

### Party Options:

#### _Option 1: Fight Back (Combat)_

Apomonosis Patrol Stats:

-   Health: 10 (Scalable)
-   Strength +3 (Primitive Weapons)
-   Agility +1
-   Intuition +2

If the party defeats the squad, the Apomonosis patrol falls. Their masks crack, revealing desperate, fearful faces beneath. Loot includes crude weapons, rations, and players in the party earn 10 XP .

If the party is defeated, the squad captures them, dragging them to a forest camp as prisoners.

#### _Option 2: Negotiate_

If the party succeeds in the negotiation, they secure a tense truce with the Apomonosis. They are then escorted to a camp to speak with the leader.

If the party fails the negotiation, the squad refuses to listen and prepare to attack the party.

#### _Option 3: Flee_

If the party evade the squad, they find a hidden path leading deeper into the woods

If the party fails, they stumble into a trap, losing 5 HP each before escaping.

### Story Path:

If the party successfully defeat or negotiate with the Apomonosis, they can proceed to **Chapter 2: The Apomonosis Encampment**

If they flee, they move towards **Chapter 3: The Deep Woods of Ashenvale**
