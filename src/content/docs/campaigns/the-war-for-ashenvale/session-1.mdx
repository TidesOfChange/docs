🛡️ Objective: Survive, explore, and determine allegiance.
📍 Scene 1: Awakening on the Shores
📖 Narration:
 The players wake up on the bleak, ruined coastline of Ashenvale after barely escaping a dying world. The toxic forest looms behind them. Their supplies are minimal. As they take in their surroundings, distant guttural howls echo from the trees.
🔴 Suddenly, Apomonosis patrols emerge from the darkness. Their weapons are drawn. A distorted voice barks:
 "Outsiders! This is Apomonosis territory. Surrender, or be eliminated!"
