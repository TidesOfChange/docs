## CHAPTER 5: THE EDGE OF ASHENVALE

### Read to Party:

The twisted forest begins to thin, and the corrupted mist gives way to a bleak, windswept plain. In the distance, dark storm clouds gather, lightning flickering within. Ahead of you, you see a massive structure that looks to be a towering wall of metal and shattered glass, overgrown with twisted vines. This is Frontier’s last bastion, the source of Ashenvale’s corruption. The path is unclear.

Ahead, you see two groups clash, a band of desperate survivors fighting against twisted, corrupted beasts that pour from the shattered facility. Screams echo through the air, and a massive creature, bloated and dripping with acidic ooze, smashes through the ruins.

### Party Options

#### _Option 1: Aid the Survivors by Confronting the Beast (Combat)_

-   Corrupted Monstrosity (Boss Stats)
-   Health: 50
-   Strength: +6
-   Poisonous Slam (7 HP, Poison Effect)

If the party succeeds, they drive off the corrupted beasts, gaining the survivors’ gratitude and learning about a secret entrance.

If the party fails, the survivors are overwhelmed, and the beasts turn on the party.

#### _Option 2: Sneak Through the Battle_

If the party succeeds, they slip through the chaos, avoiding combat and reaching the walls of the facility.
If the party fails, they are spotted, forced to fight both beasts and desperate survivors.

### Story Path

If the party aids the survivors or slays the beast, they gain access to Frontier’s facility with valuable allies or information.

If they sneak through, they enter the facility without aid but avoid combat.

_This marks the end of the first major arc of the campaign._
