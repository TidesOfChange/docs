## CHAPTER 2: THE APOMONOSIS ENCAMPMENT

**Read to Party:**

If you defeat or negotiate with the Apomonosis patrol, you are led deeper into the forest. The twisted trees loom overhead, their sickly branches clawing at the pale sky. Eventually, your party emerges into a hidden clearing where crude huts and tents from a ramshackle village. Sickly fires burn with greenish smoke, and twisted, naked figures watch your every move. 

An imposing figure, taller than the others and bearing a mask of polished bones, steps forward. “You have survived the forest’s wrath and our patrol. That makes you either strong or desperate. Speak. Why have you come to Ashenvale?”

### Party Options:
#### <I>Option 1: Seek an Alliance with the group </I>
If the party is successful, the leader considers your words, agreeing to aid you in exchange for a favor

If the party fails, the leader is unconvinced, and the Apomonosis view you as suspicious. 

#### <I>Option 2: Challenge the Leader (Combat)</I>
Apomonosis Chieftain Stats:
Health 20
Strength +4 (Bone Club)
Agility +2
Intuition +3

If the party successfully defeats the chieftain, the Apomonosis will grudgingly accept the party as temporary allies and the party earns 20 XP. 

If the party fails, they are captured and imprisoned within the camp. 

#### <I>Option 3: Explore the Camp</I>
If the party is successful, they discover a hidden shrine dedicated to ancient forest spirits. A stange, glowing root can be taken (Minor Healing Item).

If the party fails, they are caught snooping and the Apomonosis will become hostile. 

### Story Path
If the party secures an alliance, they may request supplies and safe passage deeper into Ashenvale.

If the party challenges the leader, they’ll earn the groups respect, but gain a reputation for violence. 

If the party is captured, they must find a way to escape the camp in a future chapter.
