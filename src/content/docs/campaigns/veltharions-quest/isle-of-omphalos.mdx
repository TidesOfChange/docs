![Map of Isle of Omphalos](../../../../assets/archipelago/isleOfOmphalos.png)

Located in the center of the Aeolian Archipelago, the Isle of Omphalos is visible from all quadrants of the region. Being home to both the densest of forests on its southern border and the steepest of cliffs on its north, the Isle of Omphalos almost appears as if it was a crashing wave. Its rich and diverse vegetation has made it the centerpiece for FLOoN control within the archipelago. At the island’s peak of elevation which faces north, FLOoN has built seven buildings to act as a regional headquarters, displayed in the shape of a crescent with buildings growing in size from the outer edge to the middle.

## Locations

### Tangle of Delphi 

Occupying about three-quarters of the island, and beginning from the beaches of the southern edge, this area is an incredibly dense and lucious jungle. Filled with vines and large canopies, very little sunlight is able to pass through to the earth. This also impacts the humidity of the tangle, acting more similarly to a tropical rainforest. With the island being one gradual hill, traveling by foot can become difficult in this tangle if the correct provisions are not made. **Based on the clues the party has collected from the previous islands, this is the area in which the opening to FLOoN Lagoon would be.**

### Horizon’s Edge 

The northern quarter of the island escapes the dense jungle of Delphi’s Tangle, and now is an open field featuring thick blades of grass going to about shin to knee-height. Here is where FLOoN has situated their base within the archipelago, with their looming HQs structured as if the peak of the island was an arena. The sky is now visible, but with the regional temperatures it is never clear. Almost stormy in nature, the cliffs bring about a feeling of malice. The sharp falloff of the cliffs at the isle’s edge match that of a crescent on a tidal wave. If the party chooses to engage against FLOoN, this would certainly be the perfect battlefield.

### FLOoN Lagoon

Hidden away within the Tangle of Delphi, lies the peaceful lagoon used by Veltharion as a place of peace, meditation, and rest. The entrance is that of moving trees, which bend away from one another once the password is entered into the nearby stone wall (see Journey Into the Jungle). Upon entering, the lagoon appears to be a small circle, with an outer ring of mosses and old, broken stone walls., remnants of an old city before the flooding. In the center lies a small pond, topped with a multitude of colorful water lilies and lily pads. The shallow pond is not murky, and actually has perfectly transparent water that lies completely still. The Lagoon has no ambiance, acting as a piece of complete silence and peace. The place feels like it is frozen in time.

## Journey Into the Jungle

By reaching this point in the campaign, the party should now have in their possession: a copy/note of the Poem of the Jungle from the Thousand Isles, the budding White Rose and the inscription from the Tundra Isles, and the Veltharion’s journal entry from the Dead Zone.

> If the party has **Veltharion’s Locket** from the Junkyard, they may _bypass the final encounter entirely_ by returning it to Veltharion.

From whichever of the islands marked the party’s third piece to the poem, they enter Omphalos Island from its southern beach. The party is aware that this is the home to FLOoN, as well as their militias and resources, so the party must know to be as careful as possible heading into the tangle. This is essentially an espionage mission. 

As the party makes their way through the dense tangle, there can be numerous moments where Health and group Sneakiness checks are necessary (at GM discretion) where pods of corporate soldiers pass through the tangle, acting as both guards and explorers trying to find the same secret entrance. It is advised in this case for the party to not engage in combat, as this would lead to unwanted attention from FLOoN and will force the party to retreat, pushing them back to the bottom of the tangle (comparable to the story of Sisyphus pushing up the boulder, one mistake and the party must start again).

When the party finally reaches the clearing of Horizon’s Edge, and they can finally see the light from a crescent moon, they can bring out the White Rose collected from the Tundra Isles. In doing so, the flower will begin to bloom. As the petals expand, the party will begin to hear a slight hum. Ever so growing, the hum will turn to a buzz, and a louder buzz, and a louder buzz. 

The party will witness a swarm of bees moving out of the clearing towards them, attracted to the rose. The swarm will begin to cycle around the holder of the rose, and a DC 10 Insight check reveals that the swarm is not hostile. Using a Deduction check (GM discretion), a member of the party will be able to decipher that the bees were the clue from the tundra isles. If not attacked or scared off, the bees will take pollen from the rose and fly back the way they came, leading the party to the entrance to FLOoN Lagoon. Additional Tracking, Awareness, or Deduction checks may be necessary to follow the bees through the dense foliage. 

Moving back into the tangle, the party will continue following the swarm of bees until reaching a wide pass where only one tree resides. A large, grand willow tree is seen, seeming large enough to be viewable from anywhere on the island, yet can only be seen now once directly in front of it. As the party approaches, they should notice a door-like shape in the center of the tree’s trunk, but there is no handle or knob to open with. Looking to the right, they will notice a large stone wall with multiple rings on it. Approaching it will reveal twenty circular rings protruding left to right. 

A Mechanics or Deduction check at GM discretion will reveal that this is a place to enter a password 20 characters long, but an additional Intuition check will allow the party to cleverly figure out that the passkey comes from the journal and is SKY, with the other seventeen characters remaining obsolete. This solution can also be reached through player knowledge alone, no checks required.

Once entered, the door within the trunk of the willow will open, and once entering the party will be in FLOoN Lagoon. The silent arena has only one occupant: Veltharion, who is meditating on a throne across from the still water. Upon seeing uninvited guests to her sacred space, Veltharion will attack, setting off the Aeolian Archipelago’s final boss fight. 

![Guide of Keeper Of Storm](../../../../assets/archipelago/keeperOfStorms.png)

This is NOT a fight that can be won by brute strength or spells, but rather by deducing Veltharion's position, a worried mother trying to protect their child. Veltharion should use a wide range of attacks, both with spells and her staff. Remember to use her Reflect reaction whenever applicable.
Once the party realizes her connection to Sky and talks her down, or gives her the locket before the fight starts, Veltharion will calm down and approach the party to talk. She will tell her story to the party: how FLOoN forced her to work for them in threatening the safety of her daughter, how she comes to FLOoN Lagoon once a month to meditate, cleanse herself, and hopefully find a way to save Sky, and how she plans to one day overthrow FLOoN.

In agreeing to help Veltharion in this quest, whether directly or indirectly depending on how party chooses to move on from the archipelago, Veltharion will award the party with a gift: Veltharion’s Heaven Sent - a small glass box with a glowing red flower inside, filled with Skycaller energy, and essentially acting as a bomb when opened or broken, dealing 10 harm in a half mile radius. Veltharion will then tell the party that she is going back to the skies in search of her daughter, and the party will then remain alone in the calmness of FLOoN Lagoon.

### Moving On
The campaign of the Aeolian Archipelago has now ended, with the party being rewarded with the powers of the strongest Skycaller through her glass nuke. Players are rewarded with 50 more EXP for their efforts. The party can either choose to keep their treasure and retire back on the Beach, or can choose to explore with their newly acquired tool to another region within the world of Tides for Change. Wherever they go, Sky's the limit!
