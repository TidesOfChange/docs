## Northern Trading Hub

Despite being the smallest island of the three in the Tundra Isles, the Trading Hub is always packed with activity. Ships of all shapes and sizes are docked or moving towards the many ports on the island - everything from heavy corporate cargo ships to ferries to lightweight personal sailboats. However your players arrive at this island, they’re immediately thrown into a chaotically busy environment:
A cacophony of sounds greet you as you arrive at the Northern Trading Hub. Captains shout orders at deckhands hastily loading or unloading cargo, cutting through the din of shopkeepers hawking their wares from stalls that line the docks. As soon as one ship leaves, it seems that two more take its place. By the incoming ferries, a man rolling a food cart skillfully weaves his way through the dockworkers, selling what appears to be some kind of meat on a stick to whoever is unlucky enough to wander too close. The waves crash with tremendous force against the wooden docks, giving the air a salty quality that permeates the entire environment. 

### Shops

Pretty much everything you can think of is sold somewhere in the maze of stalls, supplied by the constant stream of ships and people. Along with the food vendor on the docks, two notable shops are a shop selling mountaineering equipment and a florist’s stall.

Mikey’s Mountaineering is run by the titular Mikey - a tall, very muscular human with a front tooth missing. Despite his appearance, Mikey is a kind soul who likes to crack bad jokes and spread his love of exploration to his customers. Mikey sells helmets, ice picks, crampons, thick boots, and complicated rope systems for climbing. He offers a rental package for a small, relatively affordable fee. However, if the party mentions their intent to climb the tallest mountain he’ll let them rent sets of gear for free if they deliver a letter to his grandmother, Eudora, who lives near the peak of that mountain, and bring back her response. He will also be very open with information about climbing conditions, heavily suggesting cold weather clothing and at least 3 days of extra rations for the trip if they seem unprepared.

Regal Blossoms (Bouquets fit for a Queen!) is a floral shop managed by an elderly peacock Avenar, Victoria. Victoria is quite energetic for her age, yelling about how good of a deal her flowers are right alongside the rest of the shopkeepers. Her selection of flowers spans all varieties, but most of them are red, orange, and yellow. A smaller number of purple, blue, and green flowers are scattered around as well, and a single white rose is framed above Victoria’s head in the back of the stall. Should the party ask about the white rose, Victoria will tell them about the concentric rings of colored flowers on the Fields of Asphodel (reddish colors on the outside, blues inner, and rare white flowers from the very center), and regale them with how these white flowers only bloom once a month and are rumored to have magical properties. A bouquet can be bought for cheap, but the white rose is extremely expensive.

Doug’s Mysterious Meat Cart is a greasy food cart run by a man who is almost as mysterious as the meat product he sells, referring to himself only by “Doug.” Seemingly a typical con man in a trench coat, he will approach the party if they arrive by ferry, trying to get them to buy his meat on a stick. At no point is the type of meat specified, but it is “certified 100% genuine meat”, “free ranged”, and “cooked to perfection”. It looks like a very charred hot dog on a stick. Although persistent, he will give up and move on if the party does not engage with him. If someone buys one of his meat sticks, he will give them an intricate compass from his coat that points towards the shrine on Fields of Asphodel as a “first time customer gift” with an overly exaggerated wink, after which he will move on and disappear into the crowds even if the party tries to stop him. The heavy silver compass has the Skycaller symbol in the middle, with a blooming flower where North would be, a crescent moon to the South, a bee to the West, and a budding flower to the East. It also has a hidden button (DC 10 Awareness or Mechanics check) that seemingly does nothing, but actually emits high frequency sound that can quell the bees in the Flower Field.

### Amenities and Transportation
Along with the shops there are multiple busy taverns and inns along the docks.

The **Salty Seagull** is a tavern that is filled with sailors and dockworkers. Drunkenness is rampant and fights are common, but you might be able to convince someone to give you a ride to a neighboring island if you try hard enough.

The **Driftwood Inn** is the primary lodging in the Trading Hub, where people can buy meals and have a place to stay for the night. The innkeeper could have some knowledge on general area lore or know how to get to the other islands in this area.

The **Gilded Anchor** is an upscale, corporate-dominated pub that most non-corporate types steer clear from. However, you might be able to find a sponsored ferry or someone willing to take a bribe to get you where you need to go.

The sea between the three islands in this quadrant are filled with icebergs, making them treacherous for inexperienced sailors. Should the party attempt to sail these waters themselves instead of using a local, the party will need to make relevant checks to ensure they can navigate correctly. If the group collectively gets five failures before three successes, they will crash and need to be rescued by another ship.


## Fields of Asphodel

## Introduction and Landscape

Compared to the chaos of the trading hub, this island is serene. There’s small docks along the coast, with cottages sparsely dotting the skyline, wide paths lazily winding between them. Everywhere you look, flowers of all different colors and shapes cover the ground like grass. Most people here are friendly to tourists, but they came here to get away from the hustle and bustle of other islands so they don’t take kindly to disturbances. Along the northwestern path out of town a short fence stands before a sea of red flowers with signs along it reading “Please do not trample the flowers!” The fence sags slightly farther down the path, and a trail of flattened flowers leads into the field - someone obviously didn’t heed the sign. This is the start of the concentric flower rings.

### Concentric Flower Rings

The rings of flowers are organized in the following order (outer to inner): red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple. The outer rings gradually transition into each other - orange flowers becoming more and more common among the red until the orange eventually dominates - while the inner rings have very stark transitions. The flowers also get taller the closer to the center you go, with the purple flowers living on bushes 5 feet tall. There are a few rough paths scattered throughout the red, orange and yellow rings, but they must push through the flowers starting in the green zone.

When the characters start to enter the yellow zone, they will notice someone running full speed down a path. If they are on the path, he heads straight toward them. A faint buzzing can also be heard, growing louder as a swarm of bees chases the person down the path. If the person running encounters the party, he will hastily push through them and keep running, calling them fools for just standing there. He is openly wearing corporate-branded clothing and has many noticeable welts on his face, presumably from bee stings. If the party does not hide among the flowers (DC 8 Sneakiness group check), the bees will head towards them and attack, stinging a few times before flying off towards the center. If the party has the compass and has activated the secret button, the bees become docile whenever they get close, dispersing from the swarm and collecting nectar from flowers.

### Center of the Rings

As the party pushes through the purple ring, the flowers abruptly end in a small clearing. In the center of this clearing stands a cracked stone altar with a small tree growing on top of it. A DC 12 Awareness or Investigation check spots a beehive in one of the lower branches of the tree, right above the front of the altar. If characters do not approach with cautionary measures or draw attention to themselves, two swarms of bees will exit the hive and defend their territory. These swarms will not leave the clearing.

### Cracked Altar

This altar is identical to the altar on top of Mount Neverest. The front of this altar is intricately carved, split into two panels. The left panel depicts a rose twisting up a mountain, blooming as it reaches the sky. The right panel is cracked as a tree root has punched through the middle of the carving, but part of the inscription can still be read:
> When life blooms… …form the trail

(This combines with the identical altar on the peak of the mountain to read: 
>When life blooms in the silvered light of the slivered moon, the bees form the trail)

A single budding flower grows in the soil at the base of the tree on the altar. When exposed to the light of a crescent moon, it will bloom into a White Rose. As hinted by the inscription, players must bring the white rose to the Isle of Omphalos on the night of a crescent moon, allowing it to bloom and show them the way to the entrance of Veltharion’s Lagoon. The players are able to leave the rings without incident and make their way back to the docks.


## Ivory Peaks

### Introduction and Landscape

Mountains dominate this island, but one towers above the rest - Mount Neverest. The ultimate challenge for a mountain climber, Mount Neverest is known to take the lives of at least 20 climbers every year. The landscape is a tundra, everything covered in a thick layer of snow and ice. The adjoining town to the dock looks like a small ski village, offering lodging for mountain climbers and tourists. The party can talk to locals, who will warn them of the danger but wish them luck climbing the mountain. None of them have seen anything on top of the mountain, but legends say it was a holy site in the past.

### Climbing The Mountain

The mountain towers before the party, a soft snow falling from the sky, coating the ground in a thin layer of slick snow. Climbing Mount Neverest is no easy task, and the characters should have mountaineering equipment, cold weather equipment, and extra food with them. If they don’t, they can find some at a lodge (for an upcharge of course), or perhaps they can convince a local to let them borrow their gear for a short time. Later checks will be much more difficult if they go unprepared. Every night spent on the mountain gets harder and harder as characters start to succumb to the cold - each night gives the players a -1 penalty to all rolls that persists until they rest at the bottom of the mountain again. If they don’t have cold weather gear or run out of food, they get an extra -1 penalty per night. Each person may make 10 checks to climb the mountain per day before they have to rest for the night.

The base of the mountain is a relatively easy climb - trails are clearly marked, other hikers are enjoying the view at different points along the way, and the weather isn’t too bad. However, about halfway up the mountain the wind starts to strengthen, sending howling gales across the mountain and turning the gentle snow into a stinging blizzard. All characters must pass a DC 15 Health check or become hypothermic, giving penalties to all checks until they can warm up. If characters are dressed appropriately, they get a +4 bonus to their roll. If they try to wait out the storm by finding shelter, they will quickly realize that this weather is more or less permanent, the wind never resting.

Pressing onward, the trail starts to fade until it disappears completely. The party has now entered the cloud layer on the mountain, a dense mist covering everything making it hard to see and the soft snow turning into hard chips of ice. Eventually, a faint glowing light can be seen a little further up the mountain (Eudora’s house). However, the way forward is completely blocked by a huge ice shelf. This can be scaled using climbing equipment and a DC 12 Climbing check. Without gear it can be climbed with a DC 20 Climbing check, but every failure carries risk of injury or falling into a crevasse. If players cannot find another way to climb the ice shelf, they can go around it but it will take an extra day of travel, forcing them to find a cave or other shelter to sleep in at night.

### Eudora’s House

Eudora’s log cabin is nestled along a wall of ice, similar to the one the party climbed to get here. It’s seemingly protected from the wind since the wind dies down to the softest it’s been since they stepped foot on the mountain when they approach the door. A brightly colored knitted welcome mat lies in front of the door and a heavy wooden knocker hangs on the door with a sign that reads “No Soliciting!” The inside of the house is very cozy with small trinkets, such as a miniature cactus wearing a knitted pink sweater labeled ‘Cuddles’, adorning nearly every flat surface. Eudora greets them warmly and insists they come in for dinner and stay the night. If they give her Mikey’s letter, she is overjoyed and will write a response for the party to bring back. 
Eudora is a very old human who loves to call people dear and take care of the “young ‘uns.” She is also an incredibly powerful Skycaller (not that she advertises it), which is why the winds around her house are so calm. If there is a Skycaller in the party she will take a particular interest in them, whether they reveal they’re a Skycaller or not. Eudora knows about the shrines and Veltharion’s quest, but she will speak only of things ‘said in legends and stories’. She will also offer to take the party to the shrine on the mountain in the morning. If asked about the purpose of the shrines or quest in general, she will tell a legend about an ancient Skycaller ritual that purifies the soul and extends lifespan. 
After a hearty dinner, Eudora will give the party heavy blankets to sleep. If they spend the night here, they do not incur the penalty for spending a night on the mountain. In the morning, Eudora leads them to the shrine if they want. While Eudora is with them, the wind stays very calm.

### Shrine at the Peak

This altar is identical to the altar in the middle of the Flower Field. If the snow is cleared off the top of the altar, the perfectly flat and smooth surface has the Skycaller symbol carved into it. Most details on the sides of the altar have been worn away over time, but the front of the altar is split into two panels. The left panel depicts a flower blooming under a crescent moon, while the right panel has an inscription. The edges are faded, but the middle can be read:

> …in the silvered light of the slivered moon, the bees…
> This combines with the Flower Field altar to read:
> When life blooms in the silvered light of the slivered moon, the bees form the trail
> If Eudora is present, she can help make sense of the altar and guide the players on what they need to do next. 

### Returning From the Peak
The climb down is just as hard as the climb up. Have one of the players make a DC 14 Deduction check to see if they can retrace their steps. Eudora can give this check advantage. On a success, two DC 10 climbing checks are required on the way down (DC 18 without mountaineering gear). On a failure, the pathway down is more treacherous, requiring three checks of your choice rather than 2 Climbing checks. Players can suffer damage or health conditions if they fail, but they should be able to eventually make it down regardless.

#### Moving On

Before characters leave this quadrant, they should have collected one **White Rose** (budding) and know the inscription: When life blooms in the silvered light of the slivered moon, the bees form the trail. The inscription tells the players that they must bring the **White Rose** to the location described in the Thousand Isles (the Isle of Omphalos) during a crescent moon, where it will bloom and attract bees to guide them to their destination.

If Eudora’s letter is brought back to Mikey he will be extremely happy and thank the party. If asked, he will let on that his grandmother went in hiding from the corporation and he can’t see her often because nobody can survive the winds of Mount Neverest for very long (besides her it seems).

Transportation to any other island except the Dead Zone can be relatively easily arranged, either through corporate ferries to the Southern Trading Hub or Corporate Island, or a sailor heading to the Beach. Cloudrunning to another island is easiest from any of the mountains on the Ivory Peaks. Cloudrunning requires a single-person kite-like vehicle and a high jumping-off point. To successfully Cloudrun, everyone must pass three DC 10 Reaction or Vehicles checks before two failures or crash in the ocean. Players should be awarded 50 EXP for obtaining the White Rose and putting together the inscriptions. 10 additional EXP is awarded for delivering Eudora’s message to Mikey or obtaining the compass from Doug. Extra EXP may be awarded at GM discretion.
