![Map of Beach Island](../../../../assets/archipelago/beach.png)

The Beach Island, with its striking crescent shape, thrives in warm tropical waters and is driven by a self-sustaining balance of trade and necessity. A variety of terrain and agriculture populate the island – lush forests on the west, vibrant crops like dragonfruit and mango toward the center, and palm trees with sandy beaches on the east. Two towns anchor the island’s economy: Ironwood, nestled near the jungle, is a hub of hard labor, focusing on logging and mining. Wavecrest, located along the coastline, thrives on food production, fishing, and fine craftsmanship. While the towns are vastly different in atmosphere and purpose, they’re deeply interconnected, relying on a well-traveled trade route to exchange resources.
As the population of Beach Island saturated, its resources began facing potential overuse. Wood is being consumed faster than it can regrow, and fish have become both scarce and disease-ridden. Whirlpools to the south, east of the island, have stirred unnaturally large and aggressive storms, while rising tides bring in waves of trash and pollution from FLOoN Isle. Island tensions have naturally risen, prompting many adventurers to leave in search of answers to this changing atmosphere. Veltharion may have created this safe haven against the great floods, but it will soon be lost if nothing changes.

As you step onto the sandy beach, the salty tang of the sea greets you, carried by a light breeze. Gulls squawk overhead, circling in search of scraps, while the occasional crab scuttles quickly back to its burrow. 

Off in the distance, thin trails of smoke rise above the treetops, marking the heart of the town. Nearby, traders push carts piled high with goods, their footsteps crunching against the sand as they make their way towards their destination. As you follow along, the smell of fresh-cut lumber grows stronger, accompanied by the steady clink of pickaxes.

## Start

The players gather at a bustling tavern in Ironwood, a popular stop for adventurers looking to make a name for themselves. As they chat and sip their drinks, they overhear a group of locals discussing a tragic event: a party of travelers recently perished while attempting to follow Veltharion's quest. Since the Great Floods, Veltharion has vanished – yet she has left behind strange inscriptions near the Crystal Mound. Rumors claim the legendary skycaller has left behind immense ancient power, lost knowledge, or possibly still walks among the storms. The shop owner, Edward Earl, listens intently from behind the counter, his life full of wisdom and experience. His eyes gleam with curiosity, as if he has details he’s waiting to spill.


## Ironwood
At the heart of Ironwood stands a massive sawmill, where the island's vast yet dwindling forest is harvested. The sawmill is the town's lifeblood, but the trees that once seemed endless are now in short supply. The people of Ironwood are hardworking and reserved, focused on their labor but always willing to lend a hand when needed. Despite the constant buzz of activity, there's a sense of unease about the future, as resources are being consumed faster than they can regenerate.

### Sawmill Tavern
Owned by the head of the sawmill, this rustic establishment doubles as a community gathering spot and a makeshift inn for travelers. A secret trapdoor behind the bar leads to an underground fighting ring, where wagers are placed on brawlers from all over. The tavern is a perfect place to hear rumors, secure a room, or get drawn into the underground fights

NPC: Edward Earl, the friendly and outgoing sawmill owner, is the heart of Ironwood. Despite his friendliness, he has worked at the sawmill his entire life, and his fitness has helped him age surprisingly well. With a loud laugh and a talent for telling stories, Edward quickly warms to adventurers, seeing them as possible partners in uncovering the island’s mysteries. He tells them about a “strange inscription by a crystal mound” and many adventurers have perished trying to decipher it.

### Abandoned Mineshafts
On the outskirts of Ironwood, the old abandoned mines hold secrets long buried. Adventurers can explore the mines and encounter hazards like unstable tunnels, aggressive wildlife, or mysterious glyphs etched into the walls. Deep within the mines, strange glowing rocks have been discovered sparking rumors of ancient magic or powerful minerals. Players can investigate and potentially find precious metals, magical runes, or just… rocks.

Players can find a geode and complete a strength check:

**Below 10**: The rock crumbles into dust. You hurt yourself and take 3 damage.
**Below 15**: Extraction of small mana crystals that sell for a high price.
**Above or equal 15**: Recover a Luminate Crystal that glows with suspicious energy.

### Underground Brawls
Hidden beneath the tavern lies an illicit fighting ring, run with Edward Earl's reluctant approval. Fighters from all over the island come to test their strength, often taking on wild animals, or each other. The space is dimly lit with lanterns, and a crude chalkboard lists the evening's matchups. Adventurers can ask around and learn the island's secrets.

GM can give tips or hints on where to go or explore next.

## Trade Route: Banana Trail

### Foraging
Wild fruits, herbs, and plants grow abundantly along the route, offering the chance to gather ingredients for potions or simple snacks. However, not all that grows is safe. Some fruits look inviting, with bright colors and sweet scents, but poisonous berries and mushrooms lurk among the edible. Players can attempt to identify safe options with their knowledge of plants, or take a risk and sample what they find.

Players can scavenge a berry and perform an intelligence check.

**Below 5**: Players are unable to identify the berry. It is probably best to discard. Yields a Suspicious Berry, which has a 75% chance to take 5 HP of damage, and a 25% chance to recover 5 HP.

**Below 17**: Identify a Life Fruit, when consumed restores 10 HP.

**Above or equal 17**: Identify a Glowberry, it looks important yet inedible…

### Greenpath to the Crystal Mound
Where the rumored inscription is located. The path through Greenpath is dense with foliage, overgrown with vibrant ferns, twisting vines, and wildflowers that burst with color. Despite the jungle’s untamed nature, it’s clear that others have traveled this way before. Footprints and lost equipment suggest curious explorers have passed through. As the trail winds deeper, it leads to the Crystal Mound – a formation that seems out of place in the jungle's chaos. The mound is jagged and luminous, its translucent crystals catching and refracting light in dazzling patterns. At the top, a moss-covered stone pedestal holds a glowing inscription (see below), faint and enigmatic, drawing anyone who approaches into its mysterious aura. The air here feels heavier, charged with an energy both captivating and unsettling:
> Hear the sky’s call
> Where beaches sprawl  
> Among countless shores,  
> The place where winds must go.  
>   
> Beneath the frost,  
> Where time is lost,  
> The frozen winds shall softly sing,  
> Of when the stars align with spring.  
>   
> Where lifeless waters sleep,  
> And poisoned tides creep.  
> A buried key, secretly kept,  
> Awaits the brave where none have stepped.

## Wavecrest

Wavecrest is a bustling coastal town that thrives on the waters that surround it. With its vibrant harbor and clear blue waters, it’s a place where sailors, traders, and adventurers gather. The town is known for its laid-back yet hard working atmosphere, where the days are spent hauling in catches, crafting intricate fishing gear, and tending to the bustling port.


### Fish Market
Where the freshest catches of the day are sold. The market is always bustling, with vendors shouting to attract customers to their stalls, each displaying their best catches. The market is lined with barrels and crates of fish, oysters, and other exotic sea creatures. Locals barter for the best deals, and tourists seek seafood delicacies for their journeys. However recently, market prices have gone up dramatically, as the quality and quantity of catches have gone down, due to the unknown pollution.
Players can purchase a variety of seafood for their journey.

### Driftwood Exchange
The town’s go-to shop for adventurers and seafarers in need of gear. The shop is a cobbled-together structure of salvaged ship planks and fishing nets. Here, players can purchase or trade for basic adventuring supplies, armor, often made from durable yet lightweight materials like sharkskin or seaweed composites. Weapons such as tridents, harpoons, and short swords.
NPC: Elaine Marlow, The store’s owner, is a former smuggler turned merchant. She has a sharp wit, and a no-nonsense attitude. Elaine keeps a mix of practical items – like fishing spears, rope, and journey supplies.
Elaine is seeking specific ingredients, and if you manage to acquire and turn them in, she may reward you with one of her unique items from her smuggling days, such as Siren’s Net or Barrier of Protection.
If players give Luminate Crystal: receive Siren's Net:
A magical net that glows faintly and can immobilize targets that fail a DC 18 Force or Reaction check.
If players give Glowberry: receive Potion of Protection:
A potion that when consumed, blocks the next source of damage.

### The Docks
The docks are a lively yet chaotic hub of activity. Here, players can obtain a ship for passage to their next destination. Players can depart to the Tundra Isles, Thousand Isles, or the Dead Zone.


#### Moving On
Players should have found the poem, and should be using the beach town dock to depart to their chosen destination. Players should be awarded 20 EXP for finding the inscription and an additional 10 EXP for each Luminate Crystal or Glowberry they obtained. Additional EXP may be granted at GM discretion.
