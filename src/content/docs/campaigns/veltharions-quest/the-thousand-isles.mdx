The Thousand Isles are home to the Southern Trading Hub, located on the largest of the islands. Despite it being much smaller than the Northern Trading Hub in the Tundra Isles, it’s still quite busy, with craftsmen, residents, and FLOoN employees alike scrambling to go about their business. The largest island holds the main part of town on the north side with the public docks, and a FLOoN corporate shipping center to the south. A few of the other big islands are made up of residential neighborhoods, and the rest of the smaller islands are mainly home to wildlife, but a micro-junkyard and small storage structure are housed on two of the furthest, smallest islands. Unless you already know your way around, the center of town is clearly the place to be:
In a somewhat stark contrast to the tropical atmosphere and breezy, palm-laden architecture, the Southern Trading Hub is buzzing with activity and packed with people. In the open air of the town square, the only visible structure above the sea of heads is a tall, magnificent stone statue of an incredibly muscular man with a human body and a pelican’s head. In the crowd, swarms of locals carry stacks of boxes and crates towards the docks, as shoppers loiter and, notably, a middle-aged woman at the raised entrance of the general store surveys the crowd, her eyes lingering suspiciously long on your party as she looks around.

## Town

The main center for all the action, the town should serve as the starting point for the party’s journey. In its stilted, palm-wood structures, the town is home to many shops, an inn, and the (in)famous statue of the town’s founder, known by locals as Pelican Jee.

### General Store

The general store sells general stuff, of course. It is owned and run by a middle-aged human woman named Arden. Despite appearing only 40 or so, it is clear from her tired eyes and wrinkled face that her best years are behind her. Vigilant and somewhat suspicious of newcomers, but not unfriendly, she likes to stand outside the shop and watch the crowd go by. This is supposedly to people-watch, but most of the town knows she just likes to keep tabs on everything. When she isn’t people-watching, Arden’s other favorite hobby is sticking her nose into everyone’s business, all the time. She’s not malicious, and is actually quite kind if you approach her, just straightforward. She needs to know why you’re here. She’s also mostly harmless, unless you ask too many questions about her younger years as a cloudrunner. Then she might get mad. 
Arden’s been living here for a long time, and she’s a critical source of information around town. If you ask a local about something they haven’t heard of, they’ll send you to the general store. The most recent town gossip is that “that guy” has retreated into the house again. Any questions about who she’s talking about are met with either confusion or more vague insistence on, “you know, that guy.” She doesn’t seem to actually know their name.
Specific to this adventure, Arden knows there was an ancient riddle etched into a massive rock when Pelican Jee first got to The Thousand Isles. Reportedly, he left it in its place on the south side of the largest island, but it’s unclear what happened to it when FLOoN used the land to build their shipping center. She remembers hearing rumors that they had kept it and displayed it on-site in the small office building on the shipping center grounds. She also knows that Pelican Jee took detailed notes of his adventures, and it’s likely he has the riddle written down somewhere. He still lives on the next island over. 

### The Bubble

A simple inn and tavern, The Bubble serves the community as a place to rest, drink, and sleep. On any given day, it is home to many travelers and tired sailors, savoring their day off.

### The Statue

Located in the center of town, the stone statue is around 7ft tall and depicts a majestic, fit young man posing victoriously with his hands on his hips. Strangely, his only non-human feature is his head, which is that of a pelican and seems much too big for his body. Despite its impeding, conspicuous appearance, no one seems to be paying it any mind. On the front of the round base is a plaque that reads:
OUR MAGNIFICENT PELICAN JEE, the great Avenari adventurer, founded this town with nothing but the supplies in his bill and a dream. When he discovered the Thousand Isles, looking for a piece of land to rest on as the winds got worse, he decided it would be his permanent home. Today, it is still a home, but also a thriving trading port!

## The Shipping Center
The Shipping Center is a local outpost of FLOoN’s operations. It handles any and all corporate shipments and trades that come through the Thousand Isles. Its grounds, marked by large metal fencing, take up almost half of the island. While most of this area is open land used for cargo and shipment crates, there are two buildings of note; one is the guardhouse, located at the north entrance, and the other is a wide, single story building that houses administrative offices.  

### The Guardhouse
The guardhouse sits at the only obvious entrance of the Shipping Center, next to two large metal doors. Unsurprisingly, it seems like approaching it is the only legitimate way to gain entry to the grounds. Manning the window is a young puffin Avenar that looks bored out of his mind. His name is Taron. He is angsty, straightfaced, and seems to have little concern for anything except finishing his shift. He clearly cares very little about the company’s property or safety, but he at least cares a little about not getting yelled at by his manager. He will refuse to let you in, at least not without an excuse to get him out of trouble if you’re caught. Here, it is recommended that Taron’s willingness to collaborate with the party be based on their current karma score. He could let the party in, but he knows there is heavy security inside and they likely wouldn’t get very far anyway. If a party’s karma is particularly low, Taron may conveniently forget to mention the other guards. He also knows FLOoN keeps spare uniforms in their storage unit on one of the far islands, and he may be willing to “mistake” a party with high enough karma for employees if they’re wearing the right thing. No matter the party’s karma, Taron is still an apathetic twerp; he eventually gives into pressure, and the party can convince him to open the doors anyway with a DC 14 Leadership or Fear check. Encountering the interior guards without obtaining uniforms for any reason will require the party to pass a DC 14 Sneakiness check. Getting caught may bring serious consequences, such as combat, increased security, or even being assumed cloudrunners, making you a known corporate target. Enemy combatants can be assumed to be corporate soldiers.

### The Offices

This is a small, single story office building where all of the administrative parts of shipping and trading are handled. Just inside the main entrance is a small lobby with the receptionist’s desk and multiple display cases lining the walls. The receptionist, a burly parrot Avenar, is fast asleep behind the desk. It is up to the GM’s discretion if an action taken while in the room risks waking the receptionist. The cases are filled with artifacts, photos, and plaques detailing the many achievements of FLOoN over the years. It seems at first to be a sort of museum, but upon further inspection, any negative, pollutant, or destructive parts of the company’s history are conspicuously absent, making it more of a shrine than anything else. In one case is a large stone slab, about four feet high, leaned against the wall, with rough, sharp letters carved into it. It reads: In the place where the land slopes to the heavens, a legend awaits among the leafy cluster of a long-lost oracle.

### The Loading Dock

As you approach the water, the land transitions into a vast concrete slab. This is the loading dock, where large corporate ships can dock and exchange cargo. It is mostly filled with crates and cargo. At the GM's discretion, undercover party members may be able to complete a DC 10 Thievery check to swipe an item from the boxes.

## Residential Isles

### ”That Guy”

Directly next to Pelican Jee’s home is a significantly smaller, run-down looking house. Upon knocking or entering, the party, surprisingly, is greeted by a sheepish young woman, around twenty years old. She has a strange, almost neurotic energy about her, which is only fed by the detective-like pinboard with red string she seems to be working on. She is defensively insistent that she is the only one living in the house. If anyone brings up her being referred to as “that guy,” she will respond with insulted annoyance. Apparently, her name is Guy, but some of the community is having an unnecessarily hard time wrapping their heads around this, and gossiping locals seem to have jumped to the conclusion that there’s a reclusive man living with her that they’ve never seen before. She seems annoyed by this frequent, unnecessarily complicated misunderstanding.

She’ll let the party look through the journal and give it back to her, but how much she opens up about her research is dependent on her trust in the party. Guy is a quiet, law-abiding citizen, but has lately been picking up on information about FLOoN’s operations that are concerning to her. Seemingly, this has led to a number of anxious, home-grown conspiracy theories, some more realistic than others.
Despite the faded paper and ink, flipping through the journal reveals a sketch drawing of a large stone slab with sharp letters carved into it. They read: In the place where the land slopes to the heavens, a legend awaits among the leafy cluster of a long-lost oracle.

### The Founder

Pelican Jee’s house is on an island just next to the main one, and is only a quick walk through the water from town. Upon knocking on the door or entering the home, the party meets Pelican Jee, the founder of town and, seemingly, folk hero of the earliest residents. In a shocking contrast to the towering, chiseled figure depicted in the statue, Jee is now a jovial, hunched old man, standing not much more than 4 ft tall. The statue was, however, perfectly accurate in depicting his avenari features; that is, he has an entirely human body, lacking the bird wings found in most avenari, and a round, disproportionately large pelican head. He is enthusiastic and ecstatic at anyone showing interest in his adventuring stories, but he has seemingly become quite senile. He gets off-track easily, rambling about his many adventures, and, when hurried or pushed, can’t seem to remember what you were asking about in the first place. However, he does remember finding some sort of “boulder of bewilderment,” as he insists on calling it, and he remembers writing down the riddle. Jee’s memory lags from there though, with him having no recollection of the actual contents of the passage. He informs the party that he just lent his old notebook to “that guy” who lives next door for research purposes, and that they’d have to go retrieve it from the next house over if they want to read the riddle. Any sort of question surrounding the identity of “that guy” seems to be met with another bout of confused elderly rambling.

## Smaller Islands

### The Junkyard

It is, quite literally, a giant mound of trash. It smells. There’s no reason to believe it houses anything special. However, on a DC 20 Awareness check, a player character may see a glimmer in the rubble. Upon further inspection, it appears to be a small metal locket, stamped with the skycaller symbol. Inside is a single photo of a young girl, around 4 or 5, laughing as the wind jostles her hair. There are no other notable markings, nor indications of who it may have belonged to. It radiates an air of importance somehow, but, being intricate and made of metal, it would also sell for a decent sum in any region of the archipelago. Players are unable to deduce its owner, unless the party has already learned of Veltharion’s daughter. The locket belonged to Veltharion herself, and holds an image of her daughter when she was young.

### The Storage Facility

Despite being referred to as a “facility,” the storage on this island appears to be little more than a high-tech shipping crate with an intimidating vault door, and a touchscreen keypad prompting you to enter your employee identification number. Neither Taron nor the receptionist are of a high enough clearance to access the storage. However, on a DC 12 mechanics check a player can investigate and ultimately force open the vault door, or, on a DC 12 cybernetics check, a player can manipulate the software and open the lock digitally. Inside there are mainly stacks and stacks of worthless, mundane office supplies, but near the door there is a box of FLOoN Shipping uniform shirts in a large array of sizes.

#### Moving On
The party should have found the riddle: In the place where the land slopes to the heavens, a legend awaits among the leafy cluster of a long-lost oracle. This riddle points them towards the Isle of Omphalos (the middle island run by FLOoN) as their final destination. They might also have found Veltharion’s Locket in the Junkyard, which may come in handy in their confrontation with Veltharion. A ship to their next destination should be able to be easily chartered to their next destination from the Trading Hub, except for the Dead Zone which may require more convincing or a sympathetic Cloudrunner willing to let them try to sail the skies. Cloudrunning requires a single-person kite-like vehicle and a high jumping-off point. To successfully Cloudrun, everyone must pass three DC 10 Reaction or Vehicles checks before two failures or crash in the ocean. Players should be awarded 40 EXP for finding the riddle, however they went about it, with 20 additional EXP if they found the locket in the Junkyard. Extra EXP may be awarded at GM discretion.
