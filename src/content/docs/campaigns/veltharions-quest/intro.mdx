Welcome to the Aeolian Archipelago! This adventure takes a party of 2-5 characters on a scavenger hunt-type quest through the five main areas of the Aeolian Archipelago. Although the size of this supplement may be daunting, each area can be run as its own self-contained mini adventure, resulting in around 3-5 sessions of play. This adventure is designed for players who are just starting out with brand-new characters, but combat encounters and success thresholds may be adjusted to challenge more experienced players. For example, you can always add more Corporate Soldiers to the fight, increase the awareness of guards, or impose more environmental restrictions. Remember that as the Game Master you have the freedom to tweak this supplement to make the most fun for your group!

## Setup And Adventure Summary

How did the party get here? Are they all natives to the archipelago, have they come to see the sights, are they lured by promises of adventure and power? However they arrived, they should find themselves on Beach Island - a crescent-shaped safe haven for locals and tourists alike. The local legend is that Veltharion - the original and most powerful Skycaller, an order of people with the ability to control the wind and the waves - has hidden a trail of clues throughout the isles, waiting for those brave and strong enough to follow them. Viewing the inscription at the Crystal Mound sets the party off on a quest to gather the clues on each of the other regions of the archipelago - the Thousand Isles, Tundra Isles, and Dead Zone - before heading to the central Isle of Omphalos to meet Veltharion herself. Nobody has been able to complete this quest yet, not even the monopolistic megacorporation Fair Labs Organization of Nanotechnology (FLOoN) that rules the archipelago. Perhaps your group of adventurers can be the first?
