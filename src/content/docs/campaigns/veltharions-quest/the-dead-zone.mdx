Of all the islands in the Aeolian Archipelago, none have more mystery surrounding them than the Dead Zone. Formerly known as Eros Island, the Dead Zone was once a thriving cloudrunner community before it disappeared into the fog. Some decades after the Great Floods, the shifting regional climate caused a thick fog to descend upon the island which remains today, making the dense mangrove swamps of Tharun Swamps dangerously unnavigable. Today, the swamps of Eros Island and the ruins of Port Eros are all but hidden behind the fog, with only the peak of Mount Eros poking out of the top. While it’s common sense that nothing could possibly worth entering the fog of the Dead Zone, there have been whispers of a forgotten rare herb of great importance to FLOoN that once grew on the slopes of Mount Eros…

## Beneath The Fog

### Port Eros

**Port Eros** is the ruins of a once-thriving Cloudrunner community that was abandoned once the fog descended. Formerly a thriving trading port, all that’s left of Port Eros are dilapidated, weathered buildings. Port Eros formerly relied on exports of rare herbs growing in Tharun Swamps, but was abandoned when the descending fog made the swamps far too dangerous to navigate. Players will be hard-pressed to find any sailors willing to transport them directly to Port Eros, as the dense fog makes it far too dangerous to dock at the ruined port, but some could perhaps be reluctantly convinced to sail close to the island, with the party swimming the rest of the way. Most sailors will know that Port Eros was formerly located on the side of the island closest to the central island. A more direct, but more dangerous, route is to cloudrun directly to the dock.

Port Eros was built around a lighthouse that sits near the shore of the island; it is by far the tallest building in Port Eros. If players choose to climb the (slightly rickety) lighthouse, passing a simple Perception check at the top will reveal a faint blue glow in the direction of Mount Eros. As players pass through abandoned streets of Port Eros, they may choose to loot abandoned supplies, finding helpful items such as rope, torches, and a map of the island. Maps will reveal that the island consists of Mount Eros at the center, completely surrounded by the Tharun Swamps, with Port Eros on the southwest end of the island. Certain herb gathering spots are marked on the map. The largest mark sits at the base of Mount Eros, marked by a stormcaller emblem, roughly in the direction of the blue glow players may have seen at the top of the lighthouse. Small wooden boats can easily be found all along the swamp side of Port Eros.

### Tharun Swamps

**Tharun Swamps** are the fog-covered saltwater marshes that compose most of the Dead Zone. Densely covered by mangrove forests, some kind of boat is surely necessary to navigate it, though they are easily found in the abandoned ruins in Port Eros. While it used to be teeming with wildlife, nowadays the Tharun Swamps are eerily silent. The fog makes the Tharun Swamps extremely dangerous to navigate, filled with quicksand, hidden pits, and muddy water. Players will need to make Awareness checks to successfully avoid these traps, and if falling into them, will need to make Agility or Strength checks to escape them. If a Skycaller is present in the party, the fog can be manipulated to a minor extent to clear the path forward. Softly glowing Blue Harra Lilies seem to mark a path through the swamp, heading towards Mount Eros.

### Mount Eros

**Mount Eros** is the rocky mountain that sits at the center of the Dead Zone; its peak is the only part of Eros Island visible to the outside. Before the fog descended upon Eros Island, Mount Eros was of great importance to skycallers, revered as the place where the legendary Veltharion the Tidebinder first appeared, ushering thousands up the slopes of Mount Eros as the waters rose. Many of these survivors went on to establish Port Eros after the Floods ended. Growing on the slopes of Mount Eros are the rare Blue Harra Lilies, which glow a soft blue easily visible through the fog of the Dead Zone.

### Blue Harra Glade
Blue Harra Glade is a massive flower glade at the base of Mount Eros, located at the edge of Tharun Swamp. The fog is lifted in the glade; clear blue sky is visible above the flowers, and the peak of Mount Eros can almost be seen. A slight path of trampled flowers leading to the center of the glade can be seen. At the center of the glade players will find a torn page of the following journal entry:


<span style="font-family: Monaco, Courier New, monospace;"> The winds have not been kind to me, nor to the land I once swore to protect. The very breath of nature now feels like a curse, whispering of all that I have lost.

I thought I was saving her. I thought the deal was simple—a compromise, a small surrender to protect her. Sky… my sweet Sky. I should have known the moment I spoke her name, the moment I gave them that key, that it would never be that simple.

They forced me to bend the storm to their whims, to turn the rains and the winds into weapons of their ambition. I raised the seas at their command, reshaped the skies like clay beneath my hands. But each thunderclap, each surge of the tide, has torn at my soul. I knew I was making a cruel mockery of the hallowed forces I once swore to protect with. But it wasn’t for me. It was for her.

The price they demanded was too high, too twisted to be borne by any soul. But in the end, it was never their threats that cracked me. It was the thought of her face, the look in her eyes when she finally saw what I had become. I will carry that shame with me to my grave.
Sky, the key. The password that locked my heart away. I should have never trusted them. But now, it’s too late. Too late for the world. Too late for me. </span>

<span style="font-family: Monaco, Courier New, monospace;"> Maybe the sea will take me. Maybe the winds will call me back to where I belong. But before the tide rises again, I leave these words for whoever may come here after me. You may find my bones in the end, or the ashes of a spirit too broken to rise again. But the word Sky—that is the key. The only way to break their grip. The only way to find the storm beneath their control.

I don’t know who will read this, or if anyone ever will. But if you do… know this: you must protect her. Do not let them use her name again. </span>

<span style="font-family: Monaco, Courier New, monospace;"> I have no more tears left to shed, no more storms to call. Only echoes.
May the tides rise again, and may they wash away this stain.
V </span>

#### Moving On

After reading Veltharion’s journal entry in the Blue Harra Glade, players can exit the region by either climbing Mount Eros and cloudrunning from the peak, or sailing back out to Port Eros. Navigation through Tharun Swamp is relatively easy back to Port Eros as the Blue Harra Lilies mark the way back to the port, and the fog slightly thins out further from the mountain. Players may have made an arrangement with the sailor who took them to the island to wait for them so they can return; if not, perhaps the sailor stayed in the area out of concern for the party. Many small wooden boats lie abandoned on the coast of Port Eros which can be commandeered to link back up with the sailor.

In terms of cloudrunning from the peak, climbing Mount Eros is relatively easy as the many skycaller pilgrims of the past have created a well-worn trail leading to the peak of the mountain, although it is slightly overgrown as the path has not been tread for a long time. Players may cut through the foliage with any tools they may have; if they have no such methods of cutting through the overgrowth, they may pass with a DC 10 Agility or Strength check. As they near the peak, the fog gradually thins out, and the peak itself is completely above the fog layer. From here, the party may cloudrun to the next island.

40 EXP should be awarded to players for braving the Dead Zone and finding the journal entry. An additional 10 EXP may be given for Cloudrunning onto and/or off the island. Extra EXP may be awarded at GM discretion
