## HARBORING HORRORS
---

The salty winds of the seas help disguise the smell of the floating trash heaps Wanderers call the Wastelands. While it’s hardly a place anyone would want to live, these Wastelands are ideal places for scavengers to find any and all old world tech they could need. Your party is part of a newly formed Wandering family, and this is your party's first mission together. Extending from the soilless island is a makeshift dock hobbled together with scrap metal and seaweeds. 

At the helm of your ship, a cabin cruiser, is an old tattooed man. He’s quite gaunt, and what little hair he has left is thin and long. The man named Skipper is one of the elders of your new family, and he pulls you all together just before docking. 

“Aye lads, tighten up we’ll be docking shortly. We need dive suits so we can start doing deep sea expeditions. Scavenging on the wastelands works, but the real treasures are down below. Don go tryna become legends on day zero lookin for skiff hulls and fancy ‘Tier tech. I ain’t looking to go back with half the family we left with ya? However many of you that can’t breathe underwater will be needing one, and it would be best to try and find an extra for spare. Find what ya can, and be back. If my charts are accurate, this here oughta be a fresh dock, so there should be treasures a plenty if any of ya’s are a wee bit capable. Oh, and never forget. Stay. Out. Of. Da. mist.”

---

Skipper parks the ship and says he’ll wait for the party to return. This is where the party will eventually meet Luna, the first infected NPC, after they explore the Wastes for dive suits. The party is now free to explore out in the Wastes. In the distance from the dock, the players can make out three structures. There’s a large tower, a large cylindrical building, and a curved structure sticking out of some trash with a flag just barely visible. 

With an Awareness DC 12 check, the party can recognize the tower is a natural gravitational anomaly formation and there will be a greater concentration of gear there. Anyone of the Wanderer species will recognize the cylindrical hut as a standing site. A Deduction DC 14 will inform a player that the curved structure is an old wrecked Frontier cargo ship. If they can’t discern what the structures are from afar, they will discover this information once they get to the location.

The players will pursue one area at a time. Once they decide on a location to explore, the GM will roll D6 to see which location mist rolls in on.

| Roll       | Mist Covers        |
|------------|--------------------|
| 1–3        | The Shipwreck      |
| 4–5        | The Standing Site  |
| 6          | The Trash Heap     |

If the mist rolls in on another location, the GM doesn’t tell the party anything. If the mist rolls in on their location, they party can still choose to explore but they’ll have to deal with the mist. They can go to another location instead, but the GM will roll again for the mist. **See mist mechanic information for details**

After going to a location, the party can choose to head back to the port if they’re satisfied or explore another location. Traveling between locations uses time which allows the possibility of more mist to roll in as they are travelling on foot. The mist stays in a location once it possesses it. Players can only start recovering their sanity in locations without mist (i.e their sanity won’t restore while traveling).

<h3 style={{ color: '#8B0000' }}>The Shipwreck</h3>

Here the players find a section of a capsized Frontier cargo ship.

Any party member can make a foraging DC 12 to identify an open container containing the dive suits they need. They can see it is near the top of the shipwreck, and will require significant effort to get there. 

There’s a precarious path of cargo nets and pipes that seem safe enough to try and climb one’s way up to the cargo container. There’s also lots of rope and scrap metal around, and a good enough engineer may be able to scrape together a single-use grapple to try and pull one of the suits down, as they are exposed. An extremely talented marksman could also try and use a different projectile to knock it down, but this could also damage the suits. 

Each party member can make either a Climbing DC 12, a Mechanics DC 12 check, or a shooting DC 12 threshold check to try and acquire a diving suit. Critical failing the climb results in the player falling, taking harm and ruining the climbing path. Critical failing the mechanics check results in the container door becoming closed, making future checks +2 harder. Critical failing the shooting check results in the suits being damaged, removing its health bonus.

- The diving suits they find here are very high quality. They are lined with extra-radiation proof armor plates, giving them a +2 to their harm thresholds when wearing them in water

Aside from the diving suits, the party can also investigate the shipwreck with a Vehicles check. If they surpass a DC 14 they can find a working ship navigation matrix, a very valuable commodity to any Wandering trader. Above a DC 10 they can find less valuable ship parts they can later trade with Wandering traders. There is only one Nav unit to find, but each player who rolls above a 10 finds 2 lesser ship parts.

<h3 style={{ color: '#8B0000' }}>The Junkyard (A standing site): </h3>

**If the mist has arrived at this location**, the party instead finds it’s been abandoned, seemingly in a hurry as warm plates of food are still set out on tables. The merchant and their wares isn’t behind the counter anymore and instead there’s a sign that says he’ll return when the mist recedes. With an awareness roll of 15 the party can find 3 lesser ship parts lying around on tables of abandoned card games.

**If the fog hasn’t arrived yet, the following occurs**

---

A simply constructed hut made from the steel scrap littered across the Wasteland, its humble appearance has not deterred the many occupants from finding refuge in its walls. All kinds of species are sitting at tables drinking and playing cards, and standing behind a fenced off counter is a **Wandering Trader**.

> “What are ya buying?”

---

Talking with the merchant the party finds that they have a set of standard Wandering dive suits, and they'll trade them the full set to the party for 10 lesser ship parts. 
If a Charm check of 12 is passed they’ll also offer the party information about the surrounding areas:
- At The Shipwreck, they’ll likely find high quality dive suits, but they’ll be difficult to reach. They can also find ship parts fairly easily at the wreck. The merchant also mentions that if they can find anything special at the ship wreck, they’ll trade them a special harpoon gun. **If the party has already been to the shipwreck, they can give them the Nav unit, or they can try and pass a 14 barter check to trade for the harpoon gun with 10 lesser ship parts instead** 
  - **The harpoon gun is a sleek, ivory weapon with engravings of whales, giant squids, and old ships. It seems centuries old, but shows very little signs of deterioration. The harpoon gun does 2 harm.**
- At **The Trash Heap** the party can probably find anything they're looking for but it will likely be damaged from being swept up in the magneto-gravitational currents. They can also likely find lesser ship parts there if they look closely.

If the party already has dive suits, they can trade their lesser ship parts 1-1 for medpacks. 

The dive suits the merchant sells have no special attributes.

OPTIONAL: Assuming there’s no mist and the bar is occupied the party can gamble any ship parts they have with some of the occupants of the bar. The GM can choose any dice game and give payouts proportionally. A simple game is dice roulette:

The player picks either evens/odds, 2 numbers, or a single number to place their bet on for a D6 dice roll. If their bet hits, the payout is 2x, 3x, or 6x respectively.

<h3 style={{ color: '#8B0000' }}>The Trash Heap: </h3>

The party arrives at a heaping stalagmite of waste. With a base about 50 feet in diameter, and nearly 100 feet tall, the pillar towers over everything around it. Surrounding the behemoth are countless smaller stalagmites standing no more than 6ft tall, some of which seem to have been broken up by other scavengers searching for supplies.

The party can search the area for dive suits and other supplies. Each player can roll an Awareness check for how many searchable trash stalagmites they can find. 

Results:  
`<7`: They can’t find anything  
`7–10`: They find 1 with 2 lesser ship parts  
`11–14`: They find 2 lesser ship parts and a slightly damaged dive suit  
`15+`: They find 4 lesser ship parts and a slightly damaged dive suit  
`Nat 20`: They find 4 lesser ship parts and a standard quality dive suit

**The damaged quality dive suit is tight where you want it to lose, and has holes where you want protection. The player suffers -1 agility and no harm soaking while wearing these dive suits.**

The party can continue going back and forth between locations as long as they wish and as long as their sanity remains. <u>It’s okay for the party to leave before each member has a dive suit.</u>
**ON THE WAY BACK TO THE PORT TO MEET WITH SKIPPER**, the mists begin rolling in behind. About half way back, Players hear someone yelling for help in the distance. 

---

  “Help! Please! I–I know when the mists are coming. Whoever is out there, you’ll be caught if you continue to the ports this way. Please help me and I’ll get you out safely!”
  
  You see a young woman leaning up against some rubble, a large harpoon made out of bone set beside her. She’s covering her left arm with her other hand. Her leg seems injured, the trousers of her overalls cut up and made into a makeshift tourniquet. You see just the edges of a large gash. A trail in the dirt behind her signifies that she’s been dragging herself with her weapon for a while. Her face is filled with exhaustion before she spots you and is now replaced with excitement and hope. 

  “Oh, good.” She says relieved, but still wary as she shrinks back with her arm. It’s hard to tell what happened with that injury. “Please–you have to help me. I’ve been yelling for so long. You have to take me back to the port. I need to see the Doctor.”

---

If the players make an Awareness check (DC 14) to examine her from a distance, they see a glint in her injured arm, but see no blood or liquid that could cause the sheen.

The injured woman is Luna, a 24 year old female who is severely wounded. She has been traveling for a long while with these injuries and looks like she would travel even more–if she could. Luna belongs to a Wayfaring group that tends to work individually but gathers together at The Ark during breaks or when something goes wrong. Her ship’s name is The Farlong and they mainly work to supply The Ark through fishing and redistributing food at drop off points. Her Buccaneer expertise tree will max out on Fishing first, then Piracy. The Farlong has skiffs to deploy for them to do individual work. Though she usually feels skeptical around strangers, if she doesn’t get help here, she will die. Players might not feel the urge to help or try to leave. Luna will convince them to help if they ask why they should–if they don’t ask, she will try to convince them anyway.

If the party is full of Outsiders, seeing that the players don’t belong in the wasteland, Luna will convince them that she will promise to be their guide around the edges as long as they take her back to the port in return. If any of the players is a Wanderer, Luna will promise that she will hand over an extra 10% of her scavenging haul back to her ship and that they will have the loyalty of her Wandering crew. Luna is loyal to her Wandering family and will act very wary if a player asks too much about it. She will not answer questions about The Ark or anything else, and will only mention Farlong as her ship and that she and her crew are Wayfarers that fish.

If Luna is healed in any way:
- If players try traditional medical treatments, her wound is healing strangely slowly, as if medicine has a weaker effect on her
- If players try magic healing, her wound is healed but the bone is fused where it is still sticking out. Due to her gratitude to the players, Luna will voluntarily confess her symptoms if the player has not discovered it by the end of this encounter.
- If the players choose to talk to Luna she will reveal the following information:
- “I met a Wastehowl while looking for supplies. The injury to my arm was sustained while fighting it. It tore a chunk of it open…I think it bit through my bone. Or at least, it sounded like it.”
- “My leg injury was from its claws, and it still seems to be bleeding out. I’ve been using my weapon as some sort of crutch, but I can’t risk doing that any more than I already have.”
- “It was obviously painful when I was struck down–it lunged at me and swiped at me as I managed to shoot at it to get away…gun blew up though, hence the singed fingertips. Everything’s still numb, surprisingly, doesn’t hurt as much as it usually would–but, maybe I’m still in that adrenaline dump–you know, I’m very glad you found me. So, all that matters is getting me out of here.” (Make players roll an Insight check DC 10. They realize that what she said made her nervous. She slipped up and is now trying to distract the characters from what she just said.)

From this point on, pressing Luna about her injuries will need an Insight or Charm check DC 14. If players succeed on the check, Luna will proceed to show the characters her wound. Her bone has fractured, with one jutting out near her elbow. It looks mottled and rotten at the joints. (If a character has a sanity status effect, they lose sanity by 5% by seeing this.) At first, it seems like an infection, but at a closer look it looks like a mutation. Players know that species like Avenari or Moby have come from unnatural mutations from pollution and radiation, and that Wanderers have worked hard to avoid it and keep their human forms. Wanderers often get sick from the Wastelands, and radiation sickness often causes odd symptoms and strange mutative effects:
