## TO THE WORLD WE ONCE KNEW

---

It takes considerable time and effort to reach the drifting skiff. Once on board, you find a note on the control board. ‘New orders, had to ship out. Felt wrong leaving you, accidentally forgot to knot this skiff in. - Captain Skipper.’ Whoever has the highest vehicle skills can captain the skiff as you navigate your way back to The Ark. 
As you pull into The Ark, you notice that its engines are not running, leaving the ship floating in place. Finally making it out of the hangar, you find the general population area is in a state of total disarray. It’s far more chaotic than it was last time you were here, with residents scattered around the deck. Their faces are adorned with a variety of gas masks and with scared expressions they shift around as the cramped space will allow. They’re questioning The Ark personnel around them, who merely state to stay still and wait for orders from Maintenance. Many of them are coughing up blood, with wounds similar to Luna’s.

---

Most individuals are too confused to answer any questions. One thing for sure is that no one can get a hold of Maintenance, and it's obvious that whatever Luna had has spread throughout the population. Access inside the ship’s main building has been prohibited and some residents are trapped in the lockdown, if they haven’t been sent to the hull–some NPCs might be asking guards where they are. Luna is nowhere to be seen.

A hand begins to whisk the party away, grabbing one of the characters on the shoulder. The individual is lithe, with wild hair, large bug-like goggles and a scarf rather than a mask around his neck. He motions the party to follow him, quietly. Characters can make an Insight check against this man, but it is pretty clear that he is harmless. This individual’s name is Manny, and he works as a mechanic under The Engineer.

Wordless, Manny guides the party, weaving through the crowd before pointing overboard. Looking down at the side of the hull reveals a ladder that has been placed precariously on a thin windowsill, bolted down in a hurry. The end connects to a small opening on the side of the ship, cut out merely moments ago. If the players question Manny, he responds in sign language. It seems like he’s telling them to make the trip down there.

The party must make a Climbing check DC 13 to climb down and crawl into the hole. It is tight, but big enough for most people to fit through. The climb down is a little shaky as the bottom of the ladder hangs free. Manny goes last–he motions to the party to hold the ladder. He begins pulling out a small power drill and removing the bolts off the ladder, whoever is holding the ladder must make a Strength check DC 15 in order to keep it up long enough for him to climb down. If Manny falls, he simply activates a floatation device on his person and uses a grappling hook to enter. This guy seems pretty agile. If a player falls, then he will throw down a rope–they may try again and this time succeed. However, they lose one item from their inventory.

Once inside, Manny will cover the hole back up with a sheet of metal on the ground, pulling up a tube that fills its sides with a metallic glue-like material. He gestures to a latch, which will lead down to the Engine room. The climb this time is much easier.

**Engine Room**

      It doesn’t take a mechanical mastermind to understand that whatever is happening down here isn’t good. Steam is pouring out of pipes that run through the ceiling, large machinery is making deep crunching noises, something has been leaking oil resulting in the floors becoming covered in slick black goop. In the middle of all the chaos is a short man, literally dangling from the ceiling by his legs, desperately trying to reaffix some connections in the pipes. “Great, helpers! Someone else finally made it other than Manny! One of you find the source of the oil leak, and someone else find out what’s making that god awful noise. I’ll deal with the damaged pipes. Chop Chop!”

Awareness DC 12 to find the source of the oil leak and a Mechanics check DC 12 to fix the broken machinery but resulting in 1 harm, DC 15 to fix it without getting injured. 

If the party is able to fix at least one of these, he will be open to give them information now that his hands aren't as busy:

- “We haven’t been receiving the usual messages from the Captain about how much power to give the ship and other system updates.” 
- “Most of my mechanics got sick and are out on deck for quarantine. Manny here is the only one left with me that hasn’t caught those darn symptoms. Maybe it’s because he never opens his mouth…one of the qualities that I enjoy about him. We were locked down in here together.” 
- “I got sick of waiting and saw your skiff in the distance. Figure you found something out and could help. Luckily, our quarters aren’t so fancily locked by mechanisms and control access, so we were able to get to a floor above water to then make an exit to the outside world. As painful as that was to do. This is an unprecedented situation.”
- “I held the ladder for Manny to get up, bolt it down, and grab you.”
- After talking with the party, he becomes suddenly distracted, “Gosh Darnit, more weird noises. And it looks like something else is breaking on either side of the room. I’ll go see what’s going on over there, can you do me one more favor and check out what’s up with the message chute?”
