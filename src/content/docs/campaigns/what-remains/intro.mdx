## CAMPAIGN OVERVIEW
<span style={{ color: 'red' }}>What Remains</span> is a post-apocalypse eldritch thriller campaign that is suitable for low-level beginning players who are up for a little bit of challenge and mystery. Using the content of <span style={{ color: 'blue' }}>Wandering Hope</span>–which introduces the Wanderer subspecies of humans in Tides of Change, the Edges of Civilization, and Buccaneer and Faith Sworn backgrounds–the campaign of <span style={{ color: 'red' }}>What Remains</span> begins on a journey through the Wastelands, explores Karkorte, and introduces the main faction and vessel of the Wanderers called the Ark. Many encounters can be adjusted in challenge level by adding or decreasing monsters, consequences, reward, or stakes–or by using material from the rest of the environment. Though this campaign is outlined for three sessions, the material in this campaign can be expanded into a long-running one. 
- **Before you start.** Each member of the group must have an explanation for why they became Wayfaring wanderers and decided to join the same Wandering Ship.
  - If characters are **NOT Wanderers** it is not impossible, but uncommon. They must think of a reason for why they are there or how they go around these lands. Remember, outsider species might have more trouble surviving in such an environment and might be under scrutiny by other Wanderers. Does this character hide their identity? Are they from a Standing Site? How much would they know about Wandering Culture?

## SYNOPSIS
Wanderers have adapted to this volatile world by living on ships, with some becoming Wayfarers who scavenge the land and seas. The mothership of the Ark provides a safe haven for most of the Wanderer population, guided by a council of ten of the most knowledgeable individuals in this society. The Captain, The Quartermaster, The Engineer, The Janitor, The Archivist, The Botanist, The Doctor, The Zookeeper, and The Head Chef all maintain and collect the “Old World” which details the history of human society before it collapsed itself. The yearning to return to how things were before–the hope for a chance to do things better–for histories, cultures, climates, and people they all once were. This is what has kept Wanderers going. However, Wandering society is in danger when a young Wayfarer appears with a novel illness that seems to be slowly spreading among the population. Thinking that this might be a stronger strain of pollution and radiation sickness, it becomes of the utmost importance that the Ark find out more in order to combat the already losing battle of survival for these last remaining humans.


## CAMPAIGN OUTLINE 
<h3 style={{ color: 'red' }}>Session 1: Harboring Horrors</h3>
Player levels 1-2
Aboard an old skiff, “Horizonseeker,” Captain Skipper sends his newfound crew on their first expedition for supplies. A blood-red mist grows thick and close, but the players hear the cries of Luna, a Wayfarer, who seems struck with a suspicious injury. They must escape back through the port before the mist catches up to them as Kakorte’s monsters uncharacteristically reach their shores. As players escape on The Ark, they find a Doctor to help Luna, and a mystery in her wounds that threatens the safety of all Wanderers, which they are now tasked by Maintenance to investigate. 

<h3 style={{ color: 'red' }}>Session 2: A Final Frontier</h3>
Player levels 2-3
After dropping anchor in Karkorte, the party must enter and investigate the underwater city under a time limit due to faulty diving gear. They must explore the Frontier Lab Ruins that exist in the city in order to figure out the cause of this seemingly mutated strand of radiation sickness. 

<h3 style={{ color: 'red' }}>Session 3: To the World We Once Knew</h3>
Player levels 3-4
After learning that Luna’s illness is not naturally caused by the world’s radiated environment in Karkorte, players rush back to The Ark to find the mothership in a state of quarantine. The stage of this endemic virus has grown exponentially since their departure. The council of the Maintenance must be questioned and confronted towards the illness’s and The Ark’s links with Frontier.
