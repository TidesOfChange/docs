## A FINAL FRONTIER
---
The doctor may have been underestimating when he suggested it may take some time for the council to arrive. As soon as you arrived in the chamber, the elevator seemingly locked behind you leaving the party trapped in a small council room. It took about 8 hours before the elevator returned, carrying the 5 members of Maintenance who serve as the council onboard the ark. They arrive in strange body suits, covering most of their skin and wearing gas masks. 

---

The high council consists of the Quartermaster, the Captain, the Janitor, the Engineer, and the Archivist. They seem to oversee more of the politics around and outside of The Ark, as well as maintaining the ship itself, compared to the lower ranked council members, who have a more active role within the community.

<p><u>GM Notes: </u></p>

<p>To better leave this conversation open to role play, the council's dialogue will not be scripted. Some information about each member is provided, as well as their goals in this conversation. Their icons showcase the council members in more casual wear. They are covered in gear most of the time, however their masks in the icons will be the masks they are known to wear. </p>

  <div>
    <p><u>The Captain:</u> They are an honest, good-hearted person trying to do the right thing to help the people who look up to them. After discussing with the doctor about Luna’s illness, They have committed to sending the party out to investigate the origin of her condition. The Captain selects the party, because even though the party is a new group, they have already been exposed to Luna and don't want to risk putting more people in danger. </p>

    <p><u>The Quartermaster:</u> is trying to cover up her involvement in skimming scavenged materials, particularly those from Karkorte. She will try to dissuade the council from sending the party to Karkorte, and instead lock the party in an isolated quarantine on the ship. She won’t argue very intensely and has to not arouse suspicion or she will lose this battle. </p>

  <div>
    <p><u>The Archivist:</u> is a little too excited about the opportunity to record such an interesting modern event. They will seem detached from the reality of the situation and the lives that could be lost from a new infection. Ironically, they are the ones who direct the party to Karkorte, noting that much recorded history details the outpouring of mutated creatures in the bubble (Referencing Rinoalk). He posits that if this wasn’t a radioactive mutation then perhaps it's a mutated virus. They will cite the unusual presence of monsters from Karkote as evidence of their theory. </p>

  <div>
    <p><u>The Janitor:</u> is a calming presence in the chaos. He maintains a light-hearted attitude, while still respecting the seriousness of the situation. He is the oldest council member, and therefore is heavily respected for this wisdom and life experience. He is not just a janitor. </p>

  <div>
    <p><u>The Engineer:</u> is fascinated by the potential of a mechanizing virus, but is mostly interested in returning back to the ship's engine. He will make an off hand comment on how it reminds of the cybernetics he’s seen on people before. When Karkote is mentioned by the Archivist, he will mention how lots of cybernetic gear scavenged by Wayfarers supposedly comes from an old Frontier lab out that way.  </p>

By the end of the conversation, the council, with the Quartermaster reluctantly in agreement, decides to have the party investigate Karkote for anything they can find out about the virus.
With this decision, the Quartermaster will notify her partners-in-crime: The Doctor, The Zookeeper, and The Botanist. Whilst the players are in *Karkorte*, they concoct a plan to order a mass lockdown of the ship in order to speed up their plans of infecting humanity with *Chromagenesis*. The Quartermaster will keep The Captain distracted and ill-advised. The Zookeeper will infect some of his animals to let loose and spread to Wandering civilians. The Botanist will spread fungi with spores that release the virus.

---

The Quartermaster speaks to the party as the council leaves, having made their decision. She speaks assertively, but with compassion: “So the council has spoken. I hope you all have dive suits, the only ones we have to spare were those damaged in our most recent expeditions. I’m happy to provide them to you should you need, though they are meant to be reserves should catastrophe hit The Ark and we have to evacuate the citizens. Resources have always been tight on The Ark, but with a potential pandemic I fear there is simply nothing I can spare for your venture. You're of course welcome to trade any ship parts or gold with the merchants. We’ll send you out on a Trawler, in case you get lost at sea somehow and need to live off fish for a while and need the space, with a special crew of Wayfarers from different families picked out by the council. This way no one family will be at direct risk of being wiped out entirely from being exposed to you.”

---

An Insight check DC 12 will reveal that in some way she is lying about the suits. Even if they find this out, no level of charm will convince her to give the party better suits, and she will simply continue to deny that she has more resources. If she is called out for lying, she will however admit that he can spare some med packs, but thought it might be better should they be reserved for the ill. After another 8 hours, the party sets off for Karkorte
If the player already has dive suits from the first encounter they don’t need the damaged ones. If there are excess damaged suit pieces, someone able to pass a DC 14 Mechanics check can patch 2 damaged suits into one regular suit.

---

    Once again, the breeze flows across your skin as you voyage into the unknown. Where before you journeyed on a small ship, the Trawler is almost 3 times the size and is occupied with a crew of elder Wayfarers in gas masks. They are quiet and methodical as they operate the large vessel. Far away from the wastelands, the air isn’t tainted by the smell of a century of waste, yet it offers little more comfort. The nuclear radiation leaking from the ruined Frontier labs in Karkorte seems to have mutated even the chemical composition of the water, replacing the calming smell of salty waves with something foreign to even the most traveled noses. Even the air seems sinister here. 

    Captain Skipper, the only other Wanderer on-board, looks worse for wear. He’s been coughing and wheezing, with more fervor and frequency than is typical for a man his age.  “Right, we’ll be waiting here for your return,”  he instructs you as the masked crew releases the anchor. “We’ll stay as long as we can, but the monsters of Karkote are no joke, so do me a favor and be quick. Hopefully you all got diving suits sorted out as you're gonna need them to get down there. I’m feeling a little unwell at the moment, and these bones are far too old fer dem deep dives, so you lot will have to go without me. Be safe down der.”

<h3 style={{ color: '#8B0000' }}>THE BUBBLE: </h3>

The players arrive at the top of Karkorte. 

---

    The vast underwater city looms beneath you like a sunken relic of an older world. As you suit up in your high-pressure diving gear, their suits’ sensors begin to detect faint traces of nuclear radiation in the water. The closer you get to the city, the more you notice its protective bubble shimmering erratically—it’s damaged in multiple places, allowing the dangers of the ocean to creep in. You see mutated beings–Kraken and Moby, the once human citizens of this area–go up to the bubble and gain access to entry by scanning themselves.
    Swarms of monsters gather near the bubble’s breaches, like scavengers sniffing out a weak spot. The defenses there are precarious. The bodies of Kraken are strewn around the bubble. It’s clear that the city has been plagued by monsters for a long time. Even at this moment, a group of locals fight these monsters to push them back. You must decide how to approach.

---

With a Deduction check DC 12, players will know that the bubble relies on the skin to recognize visitors, allowing only Krakens or Moby to pass through. If they attempt to pass through, they soon discover a big problem - the bubble doesn’t recognize them. If there is a Kraken or Moby among the players,however, the bubble will let the party go through.
The encounters below should be hinted at. Trying to access this bubble is like a puzzle. Let the players describe their ideas, but if they seem lost, try to describe what may be around them and have them make checks.
HELP THE LOCALS: If the player chooses to help the Karkortians fight the breach they find themselves facing two swarms of radioactive crabs - massive, human-sized crustaceans with glowing veins of unnatural energy running through their hard shells. They snap their massive pincers aggressively, ready to defend their newfound territory. Players roll initiative.
