## A FINAL FRONTIER
---
The doctor may have been underestimating when he suggested it may take some time for the council to arrive. As soon as you arrived in the chamber, the elevator seemingly locked behind you leaving the party trapped in a small council room. It took about 8 hours before the elevator returned, carrying the 5 members of Maintenance who serve as the council onboard the ark. They arrive in strange body suits, covering most of their skin and wearing gas masks. 

---

The high council consists of the Quartermaster, the Captain, the Janitor, the Engineer, and the Archivist. They seem to oversee more of the politics around and outside of The Ark, as well as maintaining the ship itself, compared to the lower ranked council members, who have a more active role within the community.


To better leave this conversation open to role play, the council's dialogue will not be scripted. Some information about each member is provided, as well as their goals in this conversation. Their icons showcase the council members in more casual wear. They are covered in gear most of the time, however their masks in the icons will be the masks they are known to wear.

    <p><strong>The Captain: They are an honest, good-hearted person trying to do the right thing to help the people who look up to them. After discussing with the doctor about Lunaâ€™s illness, They have committed to sending the party out to investigate the origin of her condition. The Captain selects the party, because even though the party is a new group, they have already been exposed to Luna and don't want to risk putting more people in danger. </p>
