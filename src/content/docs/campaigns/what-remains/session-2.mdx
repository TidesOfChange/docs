## A FINAL FRONTIER

The doctor may have been underestimating when he suggested it may take some time for the council to arrive. As soon as you arrived in the chamber, the elevator seemingly locked behind you leaving the party trapped in a small council room. It took about 8 hours before the elevator returned, carrying the 5 members of Maintenance who serve as the council onboard the ark. They arrive in strange body suits, covering most of their skin and wearing gas masks. 

---

The high council consists of the Quartermaster, the Captain, the Janitor, the Engineer, and the Archivist. They seem to oversee more of the politics around and outside of The Ark, as well as maintaining the ship itself, compared to the lower ranked council members, who have a more active role within the community.

<p><u>GM Notes: </u></p>

<p>To better leave this conversation open to role play, the council's dialogue will not be scripted. Some information about each member is provided, as well as their goals in this conversation. Their icons showcase the council members in more casual wear. They are covered in gear most of the time, however their masks in the icons will be the masks they are known to wear. </p>

  <div>
    <p><u>The Captain:</u> They are an honest, good-hearted person trying to do the right thing to help the people who look up to them. After discussing with the doctor about Luna’s illness, They have committed to sending the party out to investigate the origin of her condition. The Captain selects the party, because even though the party is a new group, they have already been exposed to Luna and don't want to risk putting more people in danger. </p>

  <div>
    <p><u>The Quartermaster:</u> is trying to cover up her involvement in skimming scavenged materials, particularly those from Karkorte. She will try to dissuade the council from sending the party to Karkorte, and instead lock the party in an isolated quarantine on the ship. She won’t argue very intensely and has to not arouse suspicion or she will lose this battle. </p>

  <img src="/docs/the-edge/IMG_0147.PNG" alt="The Archivist profile" width="100" />

  <div>
    <p><u>The Archivist:</u> is a little too excited about the opportunity to record such an interesting modern event. They will seem detached from the reality of the situation and the lives that could be lost from a new infection. Ironically, they are the ones who direct the party to Karkorte, noting that much recorded history details the outpouring of mutated creatures in the bubble (Referencing Rinoalk). He posits that if this wasn’t a radioactive mutation then perhaps it's a mutated virus. They will cite the unusual presence of monsters from Karkote as evidence of their theory. </p>

<div style={{ display: 'flex', alignItems: 'flex-start', gap: '1rem' }}>
  <img src="/docs/the-edge/IMG_0146.PNG" alt="The Janitor profile" width="100" />

  <div>
    <p><u>The Janitor:</u> is a calming presence in the chaos. He maintains a light-hearted attitude, while still respecting the seriousness of the situation. He is the oldest council member, and therefore is heavily respected for this wisdom and life experience. He is not just a janitor. </p>

  </div>
</div>

<div style={{ display: 'flex', alignItems: 'flex-start', gap: '1rem' }}>
  <img src="/docs/the-edge/IMG_0145.PNG" alt="The Janitor profile" width="100" />

  <div>
    <p><u>The Engineer:</u> is fascinated by the potential of a mechanizing virus, but is mostly interested in returning back to the ship's engine. He will make an off hand comment on how it reminds of the cybernetics he’s seen on people before. When Karkote is mentioned by the Archivist, he will mention how lots of cybernetic gear scavenged by Wayfarers supposedly comes from an old Frontier lab out that way.  </p>

  </div>
</div>

By the end of the conversation, the council, with the Quartermaster reluctantly in agreement, decides to have the party investigate Karkote for anything they can find out about the virus.
With this decision, the Quartermaster will notify her partners-in-crime: The Doctor, The Zookeeper, and The Botanist. Whilst the players are in *Karkorte*, they concoct a plan to order a mass lockdown of the ship in order to speed up their plans of infecting humanity with *Chromagenesis*. The Quartermaster will keep The Captain distracted and ill-advised. The Zookeeper will infect some of his animals to let loose and spread to Wandering civilians. The Botanist will spread fungi with spores that release the virus.

---

The Quartermaster speaks to the party as the council leaves, having made their decision. She speaks assertively, but with compassion: “So the council has spoken. I hope you all have dive suits, the only ones we have to spare were those damaged in our most recent expeditions. I’m happy to provide them to you should you need, though they are meant to be reserves should catastrophe hit The Ark and we have to evacuate the citizens. Resources have always been tight on The Ark, but with a potential pandemic I fear there is simply nothing I can spare for your venture. You're of course welcome to trade any ship parts or gold with the merchants. We’ll send you out on a Trawler, in case you get lost at sea somehow and need to live off fish for a while and need the space, with a special crew of Wayfarers from different families picked out by the council. This way no one family will be at direct risk of being wiped out entirely from being exposed to you.”

---

An Insight check DC 12 will reveal that in some way she is lying about the suits. Even if they find this out, no level of charm will convince her to give the party better suits, and she will simply continue to deny that she has more resources. If she is called out for lying, she will however admit that he can spare some med packs, but thought it might be better should they be reserved for the ill. After another 8 hours, the party sets off for Karkorte
If the player already has dive suits from the first encounter they don’t need the damaged ones. If there are excess damaged suit pieces, someone able to pass a DC 14 Mechanics check can patch 2 damaged suits into one regular suit.

---

    Once again, the breeze flows across your skin as you voyage into the unknown. Where before you journeyed on a small ship, the Trawler is almost 3 times the size and is occupied with a crew of elder Wayfarers in gas masks. They are quiet and methodical as they operate the large vessel. Far away from the wastelands, the air isn’t tainted by the smell of a century of waste, yet it offers little more comfort. The nuclear radiation leaking from the ruined Frontier labs in Karkorte seems to have mutated even the chemical composition of the water, replacing the calming smell of salty waves with something foreign to even the most traveled noses. Even the air seems sinister here. 

    Captain Skipper, the only other Wanderer on-board, looks worse for wear. He’s been coughing and wheezing, with more fervor and frequency than is typical for a man his age.  “Right, we’ll be waiting here for your return,”  he instructs you as the masked crew releases the anchor. “We’ll stay as long as we can, but the monsters of Karkote are no joke, so do me a favor and be quick. Hopefully you all got diving suits sorted out as you're gonna need them to get down there. I’m feeling a little unwell at the moment, and these bones are far too old fer dem deep dives, so you lot will have to go without me. Be safe down der.” 

---

<h3 style={{ color: '#8B0000' }}>THE BUBBLE: </h3>

The players arrive at the top of Karkorte. 

---

    The vast underwater city looms beneath you like a sunken relic of an older world. As you suit up in your high-pressure diving gear, their suits’ sensors begin to detect faint traces of nuclear radiation in the water. The closer you get to the city, the more you notice its protective bubble shimmering erratically—it’s damaged in multiple places, allowing the dangers of the ocean to creep in. You see mutated beings–Kraken and Moby, the once human citizens of this area–go up to the bubble and gain access to entry by scanning themselves.
    Swarms of monsters gather near the bubble’s breaches, like scavengers sniffing out a weak spot. The defenses there are precarious. The bodies of Kraken are strewn around the bubble. It’s clear that the city has been plagued by monsters for a long time. Even at this moment, a group of locals fight these monsters to push them back. You must decide how to approach.

---

With a Deduction check DC 12, players will know that the bubble relies on the skin to recognize visitors, allowing only Krakens or Moby to pass through. If they attempt to pass through, they soon discover a big problem - the bubble doesn’t recognize them. If there is a Kraken or Moby among the players,however, the bubble will let the party go through.
The encounters below should be hinted at. Trying to access this bubble is like a puzzle. Let the players describe their ideas, but if they seem lost, try to describe what may be around them and have them make checks.
HELP THE LOCALS: If the player chooses to help the Karkortians fight the breach they find themselves facing two swarms of radioactive crabs - massive, human-sized crustaceans with glowing veins of unnatural energy running through their hard shells. They snap their massive pincers aggressively, ready to defend their newfound territory. Players roll initiative.

<details open style={{ border: '1px solid black', padding: '1rem', background: 'white' }}>
  <summary style={{ fontWeight: 'bold', color: '#8B0000', fontSize: '1.1rem' }}>STAT BLOCK</summary>
  <p><strong>Radioactive Crabs:</strong> Agility = 1, health = 10, damage = 1–3 per hit</p>

  <p>They always act in swarms of 3 or 4, they always take actions first. Can move up to 25 feet each turn</p>
  <p>Passive Ability: Hardened Shell – Takes 1 less harm per attack (except for Damage Over Time effects).</p>
</details>

- Rewards: 
    - Each defeated crab grants 2 XP and drops Crab Shells (durable crafting material) and Crab Meat (edible, but slightly radiated).
    - Entrance to the bubble

---

Just as the players finish off the last crab, the waters around them darken. A huge figure leaps out of the depths - a Kraken, its eyes gazing at them gratefully. In broken words, the Kraken thanks you for your help. They don’t seem particularly intelligent, but seem very grateful. It gestures toward the city’s protective barrier, parting the remaining force field with its own body and allowing the players safe access to the city of ruins.

---

DEAD BODIES: Karkorte has altars from their past culture of sacrifice, with piles of dead bodies. If you describe this to players and they go this route, try to drop hints about this history. [See Karkorte Lore]. Additionally, the area around Karkorte is littered with the remains of Kraken due to the relentless attacks of the monsters. Many have been killed or injured in the endless war. Their bodies bob gently in the water, some entangled in kelp, others floating near the sea bed.

The players needn’t bother searching, there are enough corpses here that they can quickly salvage something useful. They can use the remains of the dead to disguise themselves in order to enter the city, as their corpses do not seem to rot.

ATTACK AND INFILTRATE: Due to food shortages in Karkorte, some desperate citizens occasionally leave the protection of the bubble and brave the rough waters in search of food - whether it’s spindly kelp, creatures inhabiting the ocean floor, or, if they’re lucky, a school of small fish. If the player wants to find a living citizen, they must pass an Awareness check DC 12.

If successful, they will find a lone forager, carefully scouring the ocean floor, unaware of the approaching danger.

<details open style={{ border: '1px solid black', padding: '1rem', background: 'white' }}>
  <summary style={{ fontWeight: 'bold', color: '#8B0000', fontSize: '1.1rem' }}>STAT BLOCK</summary>
  <p><strong>Kraken Scavenger:</strong> Knowledge: 2, Intuition: 4, Strength: 4, Agility: 1, Health: 4, Armor: 1, Magic: 0</p>

  <p><strong>Weapon:</strong> A long coral staff with traces of bioluminescent energy. (1 Harm)</p>
</details>

- Rewards:
    - 15 XP
    - The players can try to negotiate with the Kraken to be let in, either through charm, intimidation, or bartering.
    - If the player chooses to attack and defeat the Kraken, they may loot its staff, either as a melee weapon or as a source of light in the deep.
    - They can use its body to enter the bubble. However, killing the citizens of Karkorte has consequences - other Krakens may soon realize they murdered one of their own, and the player may be marked as an enemy of the city.

<h3 style={{ color: '#8B0000' }}><u>KARKORTE: </u></h3>
Players enter the city through whatever means. This place has seen better days. Throughout the party’s time in *Karkorte*, they have a chance to gain threshold points. These points will add up to the party possibly concocting a cure for the virus later on in session three, **the Doctor’s Lab**.

#### Community Center

Like what little they saw of The Ark, Karkorte has its own building to help out its locals. There, what little food is rationed out, citizens are seen mingling, and there could be useful information about navigating the city inside.

- Here the players will encounter **hungry Krakens**. They have been struggling with starvation for as long as they can remember. If any of the players are not local to Karkorte, they will come up to the players and beg them for food or anything to spare. Players can decide to help these citizens by giving them as many items as they want.

    - If the players give them trash/nothing useful, the citizens will be sad but grateful anyway.

    - If the players give something useful, they will in exchange give players something they found outside the bubble **[gain broken Frontier tech parts + 0.5 to threshold]**
    - If the players are super generous, the Kraken will ask the players what they are doing here and wish to help.
    - “Us Krakens, we build, we fix broken things…good strength. Moby have sonar. Locate. Good smarts. But not like to talk as much.”
    - The Krakens will give them a rusty key that they found but couldn't figure out how to use [it will unlock a specimen drawer, giving +1 to threshold]
- A lone Moby is found looking at a map outside the bubble. If the players decide to approach them:
    - They are happy to be depended upon by the players for help. They will let the players know about the POINTS OF INTEREST.

#### POINTS OF INTEREST
- **Outside the bubble** there is a shipwreck that is rumored to contain gold. Though there are radioactive crabs around the shipwreck
    - Gain 50c
- **Abandoned clinic.** The Moby mentions that they had to abandon an area of the city due to a recent attack they were temporarily pushed back by. The players take note of an abandoned clinic.
    - Players find: First aid kit (3), 12c, 
        - Foraging check DC 14 or use a puzzle to gain expired pill bottles from Frontier Pharmaceuticals [+1.5 to threshold]
- Pawn Shop. A Kraken has set up a pawn shop for citizens to barter and trade for extra supplies and items–or, for rare finds that he has collected through his expedition
    - An extremely expensive vial of some sort of potion. The merchant has no idea what it may do. 200c or equivalent. If bought, players will realize that the vial reads “Frontier.” Later in the lab ruins, players recognize this as an old Chromagenetics serum vial, ready for use with an injection device. [+2 to threshold]  
        - The merchant might be able to be convinced to part with this potion for reduced cost. Kraken are not very strategic.

- Frontier Lab Ruins. The Moby is bitter when talking about these ruins, upset about all the harm Frontier and their radiation has caused. They have looted it as much as possible, but most stay away because it is a painful reminder that they are just another abandoned Frontier project.
    - If players wish to investigate more about radiation and its effects, the Moby will encourage them to go here.

<h3 style={{ color: '#8B0000' }}><u>FRONTIER LAB RUINS: </u></h3>
The players either spot or find out about these ruins. They know that this is the main goal they must go to, but they also know that if they choose other things to do, it will help. Regardless, these Frontier Lab Ruins are the point of no return–they must leave after exploring this. The GM can decide that this can be from a complication from their damaged dive suits or another attack to breach the bubble, but they should be encouraged that they should be prepared before they enter this area.

---

These Lab Ruins have been obviously raided by Karkorte residents of all its valuable possessions, with most of its structure surprisingly standing strong. In this world, Frontier is unavoidable. You’ve heard this name everywhere–they are the ruling industrial force that, much like The Ark, champions preservation efforts. However, Karkorte is only one of its many victims that have suffered through its ‘technological advancements.’ To Wanderers, they are the foe that has left humanity to rot.

---

Any type of Intuition Check that the players make is a DC 14
- Failure - The building looks sturdy despite being dilapidated .
- Success - They notice that the building seems to have existed long before Karkorte and from the Old World, meaning it has withstood the floods and looks like it is built to keep water out. [+2 to threshold]
- Perfect success (20) - They make the connection that the material of the building’s foundations looks similar to what they’ve seen on The Ark [+3 to threshold]
Once inside the lab:

---

The place is muddied with dust and grime, and rusted metal parts. Once past the very open-concept entrance and dilapidated front desk, players enter a large room with multiple side rooms. These side rooms contain remnants of experiments and studies. 

---

One such room contains a small, barely legible degraded placard engraved with a description of an experiment. The experiment relates to fixing the issue regarding lacking donors for organ transplant in healthcare–a lab full of homegrown organs in formaldehyde, all miserably failed in various ways. Another simply says: “make-medical-records-easy-to-file-inator.” Another says: “Don’t-amputate-the-wrong-limb-inator.” which is just a sharpie used to identify a limb for surgery, but does not write if it is the wrong limb.

Players make a relevant check of their wish to see what they can find.

- 1-6: nothing
- 7-10: +5 scrap, grappling hook, 5c
- 11-14: medical book (+1 to threshold) with a slip of paper inside. “A Code: 0713”
- 15-19: Broken data tablet (can be repaired, but has been wiped clean)
- 20+: Gain an artifact: A cloak of shroud. 
- A pre-gen Magi-tech cloak that gives the wearer the ability to cast Shroud once per day. Mistaken by the Kraken as a worthless scrap of fabric, so they left it there.

---

In the back of the facility, there is a hallway labeled Chronogenetics. It ends in what appears to be an operating room. In the center rests a patient chair with restraints where one’s ankles and wrists would lay. The back wall of the room is lined with 2x2 foot drawers. The other walls are lined with white boards and unfamiliar instruments. Framed, and pinned above a lab workbench is a patent for an injectable ‘device’ called the Chromogenic Injector. The patent details how the ‘device’, once injected in patients, mends broken bones and other tissue damage rapidly by breaking down dead and damaged tissue and replacing them with synthetic metal. A diagram of a patient's arm surgically opened revealing a metallic bone is eerily similar to what you saw in Luna’s arm back at The Doctors Office. The patent is locked into the frame with a combination lock; several scratch marks surrounding it suggest that others have tried to pry it open. From the information you can gather from the patent, it’s possible that you might be able to develop a similar process that acts in reverse, replacing metallized tissue with biological material.

---

Acquiring the document adds **+0.5 to the threshold**. The party can try and release the lock to acquire the document in a variety of ways:
- Using the code found in the book
- A Force/Shooting check DC 16
- A Mechanics check DC 14

Using a Medicine or Cybernetics check DC 16 will reveal that the ‘device’ is a bacteria-like organism that consumes the damaged biological material. **(+2  to Threshold)**

The players can also explore the drawers in the wall. Opening them reveals that they are mortuary cabinets, many of them containing fully metallic corpses:
	A foraging check reveals the following:
- 1-8: The bodies appear to be fake, metallic mannequins. Who knows what purpose these could have served the researchers here. 
- 9-13: While at first glance the bodies would appear to be shockingly detailed mannequins, the strange chemical smell and the slight look of fear on the faces can only mean one thing. These were people once, preserved, embalmed, and forgotten about **(+1 to threshold)**. 
- 14-19: Gain the previous information, as well as find one body that wasn’t fully preserved correctly, resulting in decay on a spot on their palm. There is tissue on the body soft enough to be extracted and taken as a sample **(+1 to threshold)**. While most of the decay seems natural, after removing a sample you realise it appears another section of tissue has been artificially removed as well.
- 20+: Gain the previous information, as well as find a body doning a lab coat. In the pocket you find a journal detailing a scientist on the project. He details how the injector implanted a virus into patients. It mended wounds as hoped, but they discovered that after a long enough incubation period, it would begin targeting healthy tissue instead of just damaged. The virus kept going until the subject became entirely metallic, imobile, but still somewhat conscious. The scientist had hoped to mutate the virus using radioactive samples produced at the power plants, to improve the strength of material it produced and limit its hunger, though it seemed that Frontier had effectively backed out of this project in fear of a bad reputation, since clinical trials were registered for the public to view. The Chromogenetics division was effectively shut down as their pilot study samples turned into failure after failure. The rest of the journal is ripped out, with one of the final pages including a picture of the research team. Players might recognize one researcher as one of the portraits in the Doctor’s office in the next session–this researcher bears no resemblance to the body. **(+3 to threshold)**

Players with the key given by the Krakens find one locked mortuary drawer. The key will unlock it, revealing an empty Chromogenetic injector, a piece of cloth, and an expired bottle of Chloroform. It seems like someone went through a struggle and was injected unwillingly by someone else. **(+1 to Threshold)**

Players can finish exploring the facility, and once they leave their time in Karkorte will be finished.

---

You ascend slowly, having to let the pressure in your suits stabilize. Perhaps you take this time to talk amongst each other to process what you’ve seen, or perhaps you ascend in silent reflection. It takes almost a full hour to reach the surface. When you finally arrive, you quickly notice that the Trawler is nowhere to be found. For a moment it seems that there is nothing on the surface at all, but eventually you notice a small skiff, floating away in the far distance. It seems you’ve been abandoned.

---
