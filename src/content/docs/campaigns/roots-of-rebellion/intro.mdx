Arborians have probes that can detect threats in their environment
- This group is closest to the dystopia 
- probes detected threats that the mountain in between them and the dystopia has an overwhelming amount of technology coursing through the sediment
    - breaching into Sylvangrove and means that they only have so much time to band together with the other species to prepare for the Dystopias infiltration
    - Their biggest challenge is getting the Florians that reject AI to join their forces to be ready for the Dystopia potential penetration into their lands 
- Send drones to each species to inform them of the issues 
- Tree roots are dying, skies are becoming grayer near Arborians, leaves are falling off out of season 
- Gather resources and fight species gatekeepers to access resources needed to combat the power of technology that is breaching into the ecotopia. These resources and special characters that must be found and convinced are the key.

**Goal:** restabilize the ecosystem and preserves the balance between nature and technology
