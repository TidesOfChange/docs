# Scene 1: Trouble in Karkorte

## Read To Players
Food has always been scarce in Karkorte, and the town has been slowly deteriorating. With increasing amounts of refugees, food has also become ever more scarce. Morale is running low, and everyone is yearning for an end to tough times. In this dark time, the government decided to implement a lottery system to pick citizens and refugees to go out to gather food. You all have been selected by the lottery system to venture beyond the bubble. 

The team meets near the edge of the bubble to discuss the delegation of certain tasks and your individual skills. *(Roleplay introductions)* After introductions, your team is given a week's worth of rations and basic equipment (includes breathing apparatus). On the way outside of the bubble, the group hears “HEY” from behind them. As they look around, a fit young Karkortian named Gerald approaches them. 

Gerald says:
> "Y’all have two options: go towards the abandoned town or take the safer route to the abyssal plains. If I were y’all, I would choose to go to the abyssal plains, unless you aren’t afraid to die. If you still want to go, prove it and show me that y’all got what it takes."

# Scene 4: Naval Submarine Base New London

Following the route taken by the missing team, the signs of their survival grow increasingly grim. Along the way, your group sees traces of a fight—scattered equipment and the scent of blood linger in the water. As you swim further, a submarine emerges from the shadows. The promise of high-quality steel lures the party, but the area feels eerily dangerous. The group feels an oppressive presence, as if losing focus might cost them their sanity (*Roll d20 to resist mind control for a turn*). 

A deep growl echoes from the submarine, forcing the group to decide whether to:
1. **Pursue the resources inside the submarine.**
2. **Retreat to avoid potential disaster.**

# Scene 5: Three-Mile Island (Nuclear Power Plant)

### Description
As the group approaches the power plant, a suffocating feeling sets in. The water grows thicker, radiation burns the skin, and an unsettling roar echoes through the structure. Tension builds as the group faces an eldritch monster lurking in the plant’s depths.
