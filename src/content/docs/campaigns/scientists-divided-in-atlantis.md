## Mission 1: Finding a cause to join amongst the scientists of Atlantis.

:::note[Location]
The Lab, Atlantis
:::

### Description

Throughout their travels in Atlantis, the players may have heard about two groups of scientists within Atlantis who are developing different solutions for pollution.

Dr. Aquatnik has been developing his latest project, the Humean suit, a suit that can easily extract pollution from the ocean surrounding Lumea with the use of Lux energy. Dr. Aquatnik has been extensively researching Lux and understands that humans cannot fully use his Humean suit without also creating pollution due to their poor understanding of how to use Lux. No matter how much they try to remove pollution, they can never fully rid Lumea and the area surrounding Atlantis of pollution and misuse of the Lux will result in magic pollution. He knows that he needs an Aqualumean to power his Humean suit in order to properly get rid of pollution.

If they choose to help Dr. Aquatnik, the players should seek him out in the lab. This portion of the mission should follow the same process as Mission 2 when it comes to infiltrating the lab, or could be conducted in conjunction with that mission. After meeting with Dr. Aquatnik, he will explain the technology he has been working on.

The other scientists, led by Dr. Umak, are against Dr. Aquatnik’s plans because they know that they are disliked by the Aqualumeans and that they are very cautious about lending their powers and Lux to humans to use. They believe the process of getting an Aqualumean to trust humans and lending their help would take too long and would halt their technological progress. They believe that the fastest, most efficient way to get rid of pollution around Atlantis would be to steal more Lux from the Aqualumeans and use it to power the Humean suits developed by Dr. Aquatnik. This would be much faster and would help get rid of the pollution that is affecting their city. However, these scientists do not understand (and neither will the player, yet, depending on what they have learned so far in their mission) that misuse of the Lux will create magical pollution that interferes with other technologies relying on Lux as a power source. This will cause their city to undergo more “mysterious” rumblings and power outages. Weapons will continue to malfunction and result in slight negative debuffs when using.

The players also have the option of siding with these scientists, although this may be less of a logically viable option to some. They can also seek them out in the lab and hear about how they are desperate to save their city and hear about their mission to infiltrate the reservoir.

If the players choose Dr. Umak’s side, they will join their group in infiltrating the reservoir. If the players choose Dr. Aquatnik’s side, they will need to find a way to stop Dr. Umak’s team from infiltrating the reservoir.

### Upgrades
To make this portion of the mission more difficult, up the stats of the encountered characters or make it more challenging to navigate around the lab.


### Encountered characters
#### Lab rat
These are regular workers in the laboratory. They likely don’t know too much about the more sinister goals of the corporation (or don’t ask too many questions). They are overworked and over-caffeinated, so are unobservant and not very physically strong.  
**Stats**  
- Awareness: -4  
- Cybernetics: +4  
- Reaction: -1  

#### Dr. Aquatnik
This scientist has been fascinated by the Aqualumeans and their ability to traverse and utilize the environment around them without relying on any kind of technology. Inspired by this, he has developed new tech that is really efficient at removing pollution but requires the individual to have really good maneuverability in the water to utilize it to the best of its ability. He believes that Aqualumeans can be a powerful ally if they join forces so the Aqualumeans can use their superior swimming and agility to power the technology to remove the pollution.  
**Stats**  
- Cybernetics (knowledge): +3  
- Mechanics (knowledge): +3  
- Strength: -2  
- HP: +5  
- Deduction (knowledge): +2  

#### Dr. Umak
Dr. Umak is the head scientist of MegaCorp. He wears a Lux-infused necklace, which keeps him forever young and extra strong and fast. If the necklace is destroyed, however, he will revert back to his original age (over 100) and likely die. He is very smart and suspicious. He is not someone to mess around with and has plans to infiltrate the reservoir in order to steal more Lux to power his technology and the rest of Atlantis, as he knows their time is limited.  
**Stats**  
- Strength: +5 (without Lux necklace -1)  
- Fear: +5  
- Deduction: +5  

## Mission 2: The conflict at the reservoir.
:::note[Location]
The Reservoir
:::

### Description
If they have chosen Dr. Umak’s side, the players will arrive at the Reservoir and in order to pass the gate into the Reservoir, they will need to complete the riddle of the gate. This riddle is unsolvable without the assistance of an Aqualumean aid. Upon completion of the riddle, the gate’s guardian Celestial Dragon (Khorn) will appear at their request and they will either engage in combat with the celestial dragon alongside other guards or manipulate the celestial dragon into letting them enter the reservoir where they will steal the Lux.

If the players have chosen to work with Dr. Aquatnik, their team will then rush in to find Dr. Umak and his team are in the process of stealing the Lux. To stop them, they will need to fight or convince Dr. Aquatnik’s group that they are doing the wrong thing.

If Dr. Aqauatnik’s group is successful, the Celestial Dragon will descend. Khorn will listen to the idea of incorporating Aqualumean help with Dr. Aquatnik’s Humean suits to get rid of pollution. The Celestial Dragon will then grant their request and send out 2-3 Aqualumeans to work with Dr. Aquatnik to use the technology to help get rid of the pollution.

### Upgrades
To make this portion of the mission more difficult, up the stats of the encountered characters, or make it so that some mutated animals or Murk Dwellers have found their way into the Reservoir, so characters have to deal with them as well.

### Encountered characters
#### Aqualumean guards / fighters
These are the Aqualumeans by the reservoir who have come to participate in the conflict.  
**Stats**  
- Strength: +3  
- Agility: +2  
- Swimming: +3  
- HP: +7  
- Mechanics: -3  
- Cybernetics: -3
