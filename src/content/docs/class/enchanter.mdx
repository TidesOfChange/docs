## History
10 years ago, the enchanter found their way into magic upon stumbling on a book titled “The Enchanter’s Code.” This book turned out to be only a container in which the [Defender’s Ring] was kept, disguised as a book. The only written words in this book-container was “Put the [sling ring] on your left pinky finger and open the book again.” The enchanter did so and found that The Enchanter’s Code was now a full book, not a container anymore. Ever since this experience, the enchanter has been working on their magic. However, due to The Enchanter’s Code being in a complex language and having a few incomplete spells, the enchanter cannot say that they have completely mastered the art of protective magic.
