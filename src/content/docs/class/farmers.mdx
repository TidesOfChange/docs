title: Farmers
description: Class from Gronn region

## Description
Once the earth was beginning to show serious signs of decline, farmers were looking for some sort of paradise that they thought they could help rebuild the wrecked world around them. But once they were kicked out from the seed vault their role became even more important. The last generation of farmers that actually worked with the seeds in the seed vault weren’t capable of fighting and thought that their skill set was better put towards passing their knowledge down to the younger generations. They were the beginning of the building blocks of those who could actually do something about MegaCorp. Their main form of passing down this knowledge was through storytelling. That is why they are so vital to not only to their society but to the rest of the world. They possess knowledge that could potentially help rebuild the world by having the knowledge of different plants and how to take care of them. 
There isn’t one set group of people that would make someone a right candidate for this role but it typically lends itself to those who love nature like gardeners and helping those who like to help others as this role is one that tends to give more than it receives. It is also good for those who want to be a part of the action but want to be able to take a more laid back approach. 

## Class Bonuses
- **Medicine**: To help heal the plants and possibly other players.
- **Foraging**: They know what plants are helpful to eat, which ones to avoid, and which ones can help aid others.
- **Reaction**: They can fight, but their fighting isn’t that of a skilled fighter.
- **Sneakiness**: They have been working with the seeds and plants for so long that their sense of hearing is on point.
- **Deduction**: They are highly intelligent due to working with the seeds and plants for so long, and for the way they are able to pass down stories.
- **Plant Revival**: The ability to bring plants back to life with a starting rank of 3.
- **Unique Skill**: This is key because it affects how they care for the seeds, plants, and those around them. If they are not in tune with their abilities, it could cause major issues within the community.

### Equipment
- **Canteen of Water**: For watering seeds and people.
- **Satchel**: To carry the canteen, gel, seeds, and other items.
- **Mysterious Jar of White Gel**: An ointment base that can be transformed into medicine.

### NPC Connection
The farmers all know Ernest Elderberry, one of the village elders, and they can go to him for help or information.
