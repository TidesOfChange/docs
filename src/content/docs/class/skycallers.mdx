## Background

![Image of Skycallers](../../../assets/archipelago/skycaller.png)

Both feared and hallowed amongst the residents of Aeolian Archipelago, the name “skycaller” invokes omens of both awe and terror. Skycallers are exceptionally rare weather shamans capable of taming the storms that ravage the Archipelago, and are both feared and respected amongst all. Relentlessly hunted by FLOoN for their valuable and dangerous powers, skycallers are forced to live in secret, with many opting to join cloudrunner cells for protection. Skycallers are key assets to cloudrunner cells, who would surely perish navigating the raging tempests of the Archipelago otherwise. Due to their innate connection to the environment, skycallers are greatly affected both physically and mentally by pollution, which is why many skycallers choose to fight against the megapolluting FLOoN. It is unknown how skycallers came to be or where their powers are sourced from, but many skycallers revere Veltharion the Tidebinder, the legendary first skycaller, as the source of their powers.


## Description
Simultaneously dangerous and endangered, **Skycallers** are the most valuable people in the Aeolian Archipelago. Widely feared for their supernatural control over the weather, Skycallers are rare beings that can leverage their powers in a number of ways but often face incredible danger and strife. Their ability to control the weather and wind comes from a physical connection to their environment, but this also causes severe health effects, both mental and physical, when around severe pollution. 

Public opinion also varies, but one thing is certain: very few people trust Skycallers. Some revere them like gods, some are wary of the power they wield, some believe they’re only good for bringing the wrath of the corporation onto their little island, and still others look down on their power as an abhorrent mutation. A Skycaller’s power can be wielded to great effect against most people, but those that flaunt it often end up dead by the hands of the corporation.

The majority of Skycallers end up joining Cloudrunner cells. While any fool can strap on a glider and jump off a cliff, praying to whatever gods they hold dear, veteran cloudrunners know that having a Skycaller on your side is key to reliably navigating the skies. Flying becomes vastly easier when you have someone with you who can stop the worst gusts and provide steady wind toward your destination. For this reason, nearly all Cloudrunner cells have a Skycaller among them, even if their exact identity is unknown to most of the members. 

The existence of a Skycaller is a threat—not just the power itself but a reminder that the corporation is almost certainly right on their heels as well. **FLOoN** is known to tirelessly hunt down any report of a Skycaller, seeking to either hire them or kill them if they refuse. It’s rumored that the corporation has Skycallers that rank very highly, known as **Stormreavers**, but the exact number is unknown. None have been directly sighted, but strange storm behavior has been noticed around the occasional dreadnought, and survivors of cloudrunner cells that have been obliterated by the corporation have reported localized storms appearing in their escape path. 

While all captured Skycallers are given the option to join the Stormreavers, most refuse to work with FLOoN because of the pollution. Those that do are viewed as traitors, but they are greatly rewarded with nanotechnology enhancements that help mitigate the negative health effects of pollution.

## Skills and Customization

![Skycallers Expertise Tree](../../../assets/archipelago/skycaller-ET-archipelago.png)

Skycallers live on the edge, quite literally all of the time. They are careful about who they trust and interact with, making them difficult to get along with. Their lifestyle has honed their strengths in the following skills:

- **Reaction**
- **Deduction**
- **Deception**
- **Fear**
- **Awareness**

Skycallers also possess a special skill:

- **Forecasting (Intuition)** - Skycallers have a unique ability to be one with the weather. They can predict it, react to it, observe it in forethought, and in dire cases, even control it.

The typical skycaller is equipped with:

- **Pendant** - Displays their skycaller branding
- **Wooden Staff** - Adorned with runic carvings
- **Compass** - Can be used up to twice a day to gain advantage on an Awareness check

Skycallers tend to be hermits and rarely engage in public spaces. However, they may interact with trusted friends who know their identity, previous mentors, close cloudrunners, and in rare cases, sympathetic members of FLOoN.
