# Scavenger

Scavengers are an essential part of the city of Karkorte as they help to maintain the infrastructure of the city. Due to the constant pressure of monster attacks on the city, more materials are needed in order to keep the city habitable. Scavengers are important because they know the land around the city and are able to efficiently harvest resources. You can say that they are the backbone of the city as without scavengers the city would have fallen many decades ago.
