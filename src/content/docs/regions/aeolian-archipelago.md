## Map and The Islands

![Map of Aeolian Archipelago Campaign](../../../assets/archipelago/map-archipelago.png)

### Center - Isle of Omphalos
Located in the center of the Aeolian Archipelago, the **Isle of Omphalos** is a symbol of FLOoN’s control, home to its central headquarters. 

- **Southern End**: The island is home to the **Tangle of Delphi**, the densest jungle in all of the Archipelago, where scarcely any light pierces through the thick canopy. Hidden deep within the jungle lies the rumored **FLOoN Lagoon**, a secret bastion of peace within the unforgiving wilderness.  
- **Northern End**: The jungle gives way to **Horizon’s Edge**, a magnificent clearing converted into FLOoN’s base of operations. Perched atop steep cliffs, Horizon’s Edge overlooks the entire archipelago, a strategic vantage point for the corporation.  

As FLOoN headquarters, the Isle of Omphalos is crawling with corporate soldiers, making it a perilous destination for unprepared cloudrunners.

### Northwest Quadrant - Tundra Isles
The **Tundra Isles** consist of three diverse islands in a triangular formation within frigid waters.

- **Northern Trading Hub**: A bustling port facilitating trade throughout the Aeolian Archipelago. This island is perpetually busy, its businesses crowding the limited land.  
- **Fields of Asphodel**: This serene island features idyllic cottages along its shores and its famed concentric flower fields. The colorful flowers, especially the innermost roses, are incredibly valuable, fetching their weight in gold.  
- **Ivory Peaks**: Towering above the other two islands, these harsh peaks house the tallest mountain in the region, **Mount Neverest**. Scaling this peak offers challenges and, perhaps, rewards beyond bragging rights.

### Southwest Quadrant - Beach Island
The **Beach Island** is a lush, tropical community supported by two major settlements:

- **Ironwood**: Nestled in the jungles, this town thrives on logging and mining operations.  
- **Wavecrest**: Located along the coast, it relies on fishing, agriculture, and fine craftsmanship.  

The two towns are interconnected by the **Banana Trail**, a well-traveled trade route. However, the island faces a crisis of resource overuse and increasingly aggressive storms and whirlpools. Without swift action, the fragile equilibrium of Beach Island is at risk of collapse.

### Southeast Quadrant - The Thousand Isles
The **Thousand Isles** is named for its countless tiny islands in close proximity to each other, unlike any other region in the Aeolian Archipelago.

- **Southern Trading Hub**: A bustling hub of commerce, smaller but no less vital than its northern counterpart.  
- **Shipping Center**: FLOoN’s large port in the region, serving as an outpost for their operations.  

The shallow waters of the Thousand Isles prevent large ships from navigating its interior, giving it a unique character within the archipelago.

### Northeast Quadrant - Dead Zone
Once known as **Eros Island**, the **Dead Zone** was home to a thriving cloudrunner community before shifting regional climates engulfed the island in a dense, impenetrable fog. 

- **Port Eros**: Now abandoned, its black sand shores and crumbling ruins serve as a haunting reminder of its former glory.  
- **Tharun Swamps**: Previously known for rare, exotic herbs, the swamps have fallen eerily silent since the fog descended.  
- **Mount Eros**: A tall, rocky spire that barely breaks through the fog layer, the mountain marks the center of the Dead Zone.  

Approaching the Dead Zone is considered suicidal by most, but those few who dare may uncover something hidden deep within its forbidding expanse.


## Environment of the Archipelago

Years ago, billions perished during the **Great Floods**. As the oceans continued to rise rapidly, only those who retreated to the highest mountaintops survived. This newly-flooded planet Earth gave rise to an entirely new geography, and the **Aeolian Archipelago** was formed. While rarely recognized as such anymore, the islands that make up the archipelago are, in fact, metal-rich mountaintops.

The Great Floods, however, brought more than just topographical changes. At the onset of this world-changing disaster, the imbalance of the oceans' natural energy also gave rise to new arcane forces. From the start of the chaos and destruction emerged **Veltharion the Tidebinder**, the first recorded skycaller. Now hailed as a legendary sage, she is said to have performed irreplicable divine feats of water and weather manipulation, saving thousands of lives over the course of the floods before she disappeared. By parting walls of water and calming the raging storms, she provided people additional time to escape and inspired hundreds of magic users. While accounts are mixed on how Veltharion’s magic came to spread and why the legendary figure vanished, more and more skycallers have been gradually discovered, all with a heightened connection to the environment.

New power is never met without resistance, and the existence of skycallers is no exception. Particularly interested in these powerful casters are the leaders of **FLOoN**, a smaller branch of **MegaCorp** that has come to control almost every aspect of life on the archipelago. Since the infrastructure of the old world was generally not housed at high elevations, almost all technology was lost to the Great Floods, leaving society to start over. The only notable exception was FLOoN’s mountaintop compound, housing advanced old world nanotechnology. 

The general public has yet to catch up to technology as it was before the flood, nor do they wish to. Metallurgy releases incredible amounts of pollution, the root cause of many struggles faced by the archipelago’s residents. 

Because of the massive amounts of pollutants generated by FLOoN’s operations, the environment of the Aeolian Archipelago is characterized by storms, making sky calling a highly coveted talent. **Thunderstorms** are very common, and the sun only shines for a few weeks out of the year. Clouds are omnipresent, even when the sun is visible, and the constant high winds have defined much of the archipelago’s cultural practices. The wind always blows at ground level, with the speeds growing faster as they move further from the central island. At higher altitudes, the wind is even more vicious and generally moves in a clockwise fashion. Some local communities, referred to as **cloudrunners**, have been able to harness this wind pattern to travel free of FLOoN’s scrutiny.

The other critical factor in the archipelago’s weather is the **great amounts of pollution**. In this sullied environment, the weather has become so sensitive that any sustained emissions will worsen the local weather. Violent gusts of wind and worsening sea conditions have been reported around sources of pollution. Because of this, most residents avoid pollutants at all costs, sticking to natural materials only. Most available infrastructure and tools are made from relatively primitive materials such as wood, leaves, and stone. Only FLOoN has the capability to avoid the consequences of pollution, and therefore they are the only ones that produce metal. However, shipments of metal can be stolen and repurposed, and research is ongoing for shaping metal without pollution.

## FLOoN

In this region, you’ll become familiar with **FLOoN** very quickly. Formally named the **Fair Labs Organization of Nanotechnology**, FLOoN started as a medical nanorobotics company in the old world, working to cure the sick and help the population. They were conveniently acquired by **MegaCorp** shortly before the waters began to rise. For better or for worse, the Great Floods left them as the only remaining owners of this advanced technology. Thrown into an unexpected position of power, the company pivoted to other uses for nanotechnology, such as consumer goods and military devices, and quickly fulfilled their inevitable role as a technological monopoly.

FLOoN is known for crushing rebellions and using its vast resources to maintain control, even as its technology pollutes the environment. The production of nanomaterials relies on carbon-heavy methods, creating significant emissions. 

After dominating the medical field, FLOoN expanded into consumer goods and, eventually, nanotech weapons. At one point, they attempted weather control to improve food production, but these efforts often caused worse conditions for neighboring islands, worsening resource scarcity. 

FLOoN is led by a council of **12 advisors**, each overseeing a division. Beneath them are workers striving for a better life, unknowingly fueling a system that exploits others and harms the outside world. FLOoN citizens are taught to fear outsiders, but the real destruction comes from within. To most, FLOoN seems like a utopia, but it’s built on secrecy and control. While some live in ignorance, others live in fear. Many try to escape, often unsuccessfully.
