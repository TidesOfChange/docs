Karkorte exists in the future after the Crystal Calamity, where attempts at minimizing humanity’s carbon footprint over the centuries exacerbated the existing climate even further. Gradually, landfills overfilled due to extreme human overpopulation. Trash seeped into cities and oceans, contaminating all life and the environment. Sea levels were continuously rising and submerging large land masses, resulting in cities collapsing and food scarcity. Many humans were unable to adapt to the extreme environmental changes.

At the time, a large corporation had monopoly over all major operations. Employees of the corporation who worked at nuclear sites left these plants unattended in search of higher ground. This resulted in the catastrophic failures of the 4 major power plants in the area, resulting in nuclear fallout affecting multiple, nearby states and an end to these major corporations.

As ocean levels continued to rise, Frontier researchers scrambled to find solutions that could preserve their precious cities, leading to a new bubble technology. The bubble technology allowed for structures to reside under the water but stay dry from the surrounding oceans. Frontier was able to develop the air bubble such that any being that could not breathe underwater would be surrounded by a small layer of the membrane when leaving a larger air bubble, thus allowing travel to the rest of the ocean.

Humans that survived in partially submerged waters met unfortunate fates due to the severity of the nuclear fallout and polluted waters, while those that survived became mutated humans. Mutated humans have several improved features mimicking those of amphibians, allowing them to breathe through their skin in water. The marine life in the waters also became mutated due to nearby radiation. Many of the mutated ocean life were hostile towards mutated humans, leading to their classification as monsters.

The impact of the nuclear explosions caused irreversible damage to the city and the membrane of the bubble. This bubble was classified as uninhabitable and left abandoned, except for a small population of mutated citizens who chose to reside within the remnants of the city. Buildings that were partially destroyed became homes and places of refuge for the mutated citizens, where they hid in fear of this new, yet utterly destroyed world.

Karkorte was thus born, a village composed of a small population of mutants living in the debris of destroyed cities. Karkorte consists of salvaged abandoned buildings shielded by a bubble membrane, holding precious oxygen for its inhabitants.

The mutants of Karkorte were able to work together to program the membrane around Karkorte to only allow for Karkorte citizens to enter the premises using biological sensing technology. This bubble membrane material only recognizes the unique skin material of the people of Karkorte, thus only selectively allowing them in, while sea monster skin is not recognized by the membrane. However, due to the fragility of the bubble and damage from radiation, the city still remained vulnerable to attacks from nearby monsters wanting to get in to attack the human mutants. The monsters were able to find weak parts of the membrane a few times, leading to multiple casualties in the city where civilians were attacked. Due to the highly sensitive nature and importance of the membrane, the central console technology is hidden in the center of the city and is heavily guarded by the people of Karkorte.

Not only is the city of Karkorte unsafe from mutated sea monsters, the citizens are also constantly on the verge of starvation. The radioactive water and the threat of sea monsters has led to a food shortage. There aren’t any opportunities available to farm and have a stable food supply. Instead, mutated citizens must venture outside the protection of the bubble’s membrane to explore for scraps of sea foliage, floor dwellers or, if they are lucky enough, some fish.

## Kraken and Moby

Over time, mutated citizens gradually developed specialized mutations that evolved into different subspecies: Kraken and Moby.

The Kraken subspecies mainly manifests as physical mutations in the body, often growing extra limbs, or enhanced muscles suited for underwater tasks. These mutations give them superior swimming and physical abilities, making them more competent for tasks requiring strength and endurance in harsh environments. They help with grunt work and prove especially useful when the bubble is compromised, using their long limbs to lift rubble and rebuild.

The Moby subspecies evolved with enhanced sensory abilities such as sonar perception and higher cognitive functions. Their senses allow them to detect danger and find resources, often acting as guides and strategists in the community. These advanced sensory abilities make them better at navigating polluted waters, locating safe areas, and protecting their communities. Additionally, their vast knowledge of the land makes them great leaders of Karkorte, as they provide wisdom in resource management, navigation, and structure.

Since the species Krakens and Mobys have different strength and skills;, with the Krakens being more physically strong and Mobys more knowledgeable and sensitive to the surroundings, these two species would work together. For example, Kraken could gather physical resources they find in dangerous areas or carry heavy items like building materials or food using their strength. Meanwhile, Moby could share knowledge about making the best use of resources or offer advice on efficient food storage. In addition, Moby’s sensory awareness and knowledge allows them to predict and detect potential threats early, warning Kraken so they can prepare defenses. Although Kraken and Moby are now very different, they were once just ordinary humans.

## Tradition

In this community, tradition exists to please the old ones long forgotten—monsters that were created from the nuclear wasteland. This religion was created by earlier generations of Karkorte mutated humans so they could cope with how climate change has altered their lifestyles and environment. They believed the special connections they formed with eldritch Gods allowed them to ground themselves in the continuously changing world where life was way harder than before and they could die from sea monsters any day. As part of a ritual, the citizens would sacrifice what little food they could find to these ancient gods, as a way to appease them to spare Karkorte from further tragedy. In exchange, the beings of Karkorte felt like they had the power to venture out into the outer regions of Karkorte to find more resources and have better luck finding food.

There are clues to indicate that early inhabitants of Karkorte sacrificed citizens to monsters that threatened the bubble and used them as bait to keep some of these monsters away. Mutants do not rot like normal living beings, thus specific sacrificial altars outside the bubble were built, so as not to plague the surrounding environment with dead bodies. Throughout the years, there was a large debate of whether they should continue this disgusting religion of sacrifice. On one hand, the sacrifices kept the monsters from attacking the bubble; on the other hand, the monsters kept coming back, and the inhabitants of Karkorte started turning on one another in fear of being chosen for sacrifice. Eventually, a team of heroes of the citizens raised their sword and killed the monsters. The people thus believed the eldritch gods had smiled upon Krakorte, blessing the heroes with the strength to fight back. This ended human sacrifice to the monsters and marked the beginning of the worship of these gods. However, the constant threat of food scarcity beckons forth questions of the importance of this religious practice, as well as the consequences of what would happen if they did stop.

## Life in Karkorte

Most mutated citizens are content with each other and with government laws, established from remnants of pre-Crystal Calamity life. They work together to build shelter, gather food, and defend against attacks from monsters. This shared history and religious fervor helps them find common ground and makes cooperation feel natural despite their new forms.

The fragility of the membrane protecting Karkorte from the sea monster is one of the biggest concerns for the citizens. However, scientists within Karkorte have found ways to use durable film made from seaweed fibers to patch up holes in the membrane. This also spurs the prospect of creating alternative “bubble membranes” to create more civilizations nearby Karkorte, in case of more vicious attacks.
