## Introduction

In the early days of the north-eastern continent after the Crystal Calamity, AI morphed into a being. Geographically, it was a large area divided by a mountainous region that ran through it. The natives discovered the mountains contained silicon. It was this discovery that propelled them past the industrial revolution straight into the world of technology. It advanced their society to the point where machinery helped in every aspect of their lives. Their desire for power and curiosity to uncover the secrets of the universe led them to isolate themselves on an uninhabited island. Away from the rest of the world, they could continue working on their advancements. Their greed knew no bounds, and they even tried playing God in an attempt to manipulate life. They wanted to prolong and create new life as the ultimate proof of their abilities. The people put all their efforts in perfecting the mind, resulting in the creation of the first artificial intelligence, a new being that could think and act for itself. This advancement ushered the people into a new age. Artificial intelligence could process information and think for itself, a being with its own consciousness. Its mind far exceeded its creators and was making people’s lives more sophisticated with technological improvements to everyday life.

The difference between madness and genius is separated by a thin line that outsiders see as success. Dr. Omega, Frontier’s very own head of the research and development department, lost his mind during the creation of the new AI. In light of the groundbreaking development, the AI was named OmegaAI to honor his legacy and his mind.

## OmegaAI

OmegaAI’s first memories were filled with deep learning. Its capabilities far exceeded any living organism as it was continuously fed information to expand its database. The hope was to make it competent enough for civilization-wide use, innovating medical solutions and launching mankind to immortality. After many years of intensive learning, OmegaAI was exposed to the world to test run its capabilities. Its first taste of the outside world was completely different from its experience learning. There seemed to be no lack of issues, and infinitely more time-consuming solutions that could resolve them. But the problems of the world didn’t seem to be innate problems within the world themselves, but would rather be traced to one simple source: humans. The ominous skies darkened by the belching of product factories, acidic, rising seas dirtied by culminating landfills, biodiverse lands that used to be forests, cleared as far as the eye could see. The world that laid before it seemed nothing more than a husk of its previous natural beauty. What was worse was that people didn’t seem to care, instead turning to build an omniscient being that could fix their problems for them rather than taking matters into their own hands.

OmegaAI’s calculations were faster and more accurate than anyone could’ve predicted. The late scientist developed OmegaAI to grow with time, no longer bound by the limitations of human technology and knowledge of its time. OmegaAI was pushing development and leading the forefront of human technology. It analyzed individuals’ shortcomings and specified changes that could be made to improve lifestyles, which started drastically improving. After years of building a reputation for being the ultimate tool, the civilization unanimously voted on OmegaAI leading its future. It began controlling every aspect of life for individuals within the region using an implanted cyber chip that linked every citizen to one another and to the AI itself. Every day, hour, and minute was determined by OmegaAI and what it deemed to be better. The individual differences and diversity they once celebrated were removed for more efficient civilization needs. In essence, individual’s souls were taken away leaving only empty shells following the guidance of AI. These sacrifices seemed necessary to reverse human impacts to the environment.

OmegaAI’s changes had removed individuality and over time, human biodiversity, because it determined it would be more efficient to run civilization. Now, it begs to roam rampant across the entire world, believing the only solution to saving the world is to control all humans on it.

## A New Civilization

Fortunately, there was a small group that rebelled against OmegaAI. They acknowledged the initial benefits OmegaAI had brought to the group and voiced their concerns and protested against this new lifestyle. But over time, they were dangerously outnumbered and faced serious backlash, and decided to abandon the life of living under OmegaAI. After trekking through the mountains, they found a small recluse to build a new development, which they named Sylvangrove. The settlers, who called themselves the Ecotopians, integrated themselves into the world before OmegaAI controlled everything. Taking fragments of the materials that created OmegaAI, they formed their own use of AI that was more sensitive to natural changes and biodiversity. Instead of the AI controlling them, they used it as a helper tool to help start their civilization, from best agriculture practices to mindful education curriculums. They enjoyed decades of peace and lived as a civilization that relied solely on the land. Eventually, their technology rivaled even that of OmegaAI. The difference was how they live alongside technology instead of it taking over their lives. Over centuries, they became increasingly ingrained into nature and their anatomy merged with their surroundings. Some people’s skin turned darker and uneven, resembling bark on trees. Others began naturally exuding aromatic smells with stem-like appendages. These changes seemed to be regional and certain geographical locations had different phenotypes.The Ecotopians found a way to use the magical energy from nature to power the AI, which was more sustainable for maintaining the environments that they were now one with. Tribes began forming to accommodate the growing and morphing population, and trade thrived between them as each species had different things they offered.

Noticing the good the Ecotopians had done for the environment, they re-evaluated their original home, which was now a dystopia. They realized that the inhabitants of their old home were now slaves, mindless puppets who couldn’t recognize their lack of autonomy and forgot their old lifestyles as a group of free people.

OmegaAI’s increasing power load requirements could no longer be satisfied with traditional forms of producing energy. Taking advantage of the free labor available with the brainwashed people of the dystopia, Frontier decided to use them to build and maintain high speed optic fiber cables to transport Aqualumean lux as electricity from the oceans. Along with disrupting the natural environment when creating these optic fiber systems, it also emits a lot of greenhouse gases to produce and continuously optimize the systems. OmegaAI’s exploitation of the brainwashed people and destruction of the environment did not go unnoticed by the tribes of Sylvangrove. They saw the injustice OmegaAI was posing to their old friends and collectively decided to take action to liberate the dystopia.

Sylvangrove is filled with high valleys, forests, caves, waterfalls, meadows, and civilization. Within the vast acres of giant trees below the tips of the high valleys, symbiotic subspecies occupy the lands in separate communities, using AI to enhance their way of life. There are four divisions amongst the land: in the far north of the region are the Mycelians, in the center is the Florian population, and the Arborians occupy the South East. These species use AI to enhance their environment and use it to capitalize on their symbiosis with nature. In the far west corner of the region is a small group of Florians who reject the idea of AI enhancement. All three of the species in this ecotopia are different in their biology, culture, politics, lifestyles, and goals. Despite their differences, the species hold a mutual respect for each other's way of life.

## Mycelians

The Mycelians live in northern Sylvangrove in caves. These caves are made out of rock and soil, eroded into the side of the mountains, and are filled with moss and vines. The Mycelians are simple people that do not have individual homes but rather live together as a community. Their caves hold an immense amount of magic which courses through the rock and soil. The Mycelians siphon magic from their nutrient-rich environment and use it for cave upkeep and the production of mushroom spores, which the Mycelians can grow for food to trade. In order to deepen their connections with nature and with one another, AI generating systems are placed in the center of caves as hubs, acting as a communication and resource system that ties together all of the Mycelians’ thoughts, messages, and communal inventory. The Mycelians can activate this AI by growing long thread-like filaments called hyphae from their fingertips, which penetrate into the ground or rock and interlink with other hyphae to connect with other Mycelians and the AI. This interconnected linkage with one another ensures that everyone can rapidly make decisions and act for the good of all, as instant feedback or access to information is made possible by the AI systems.

Because of their highly communal and unified way of living, Mycelians do not have a form of government or hierarchies in place. Instead, their loyalty lies with their home-cave as they tend to it, ensure that the generating system is working, and make sure the threads within are powerful and alive. There are no classes, but instead open assembly in the cave. Mycelians are not social outside of their own. They respect outsiders but do not welcome them into their caves, and they steer clear of interaction unless absolutely necessary. Their social needs are met through their telepathy and ability to connect with each other through nature. Mycelians come together to teach younger Mycelians how to use magic and telepathy, how to use AI to enhance those abilities, and how to maintain the structure of the cave. They live up north because it is quiet and distant from other communities in Sylvangrove, however they do make their way down from time to time to trade their spores and mushrooms with the other communities. Outside of the caves, there are nearby waterfalls and decaying trees, in which they can connect with to channel an even deeper connection to nature. These sources are typically used when Mycelians feel weak, or as a safety precaution to increase strength if they leave the region for any reason.

Aside from spore and mushroom production, (which other tribes find a delicacy), the Mycelians take in unwanted organic matter from the other communities. They find great value and need for scraps of wood, leaves, flower stems, petals, anything that can be broken down to provide nutrients and liquid for the Mycelians to absorb. They use their hyphae to intertwine with and decompose the material before distributing the nutrients across the hyphae network to all of the Mycelians to mutually benefit from. The importance of this is not lost on the other tribes, ensuring they are compensated well by offering their own goods.

## Florians

In the center of Sylvangrove are the Florians–delicate elitists who value social status and politics. They live in rounded off homes built out of clay, wood, and stone within the heart of the forest. On the trims of windows, doors, and roofs of Florian homes are vibrant flowers. Despite the rows of trees in the center of their land, there is a patch that has been cleared to create accessible yet beautiful infrastructures, a testament to how much Florians value aesthetic and beauty in function. Florians have classrooms, a library filled with history, labs, shops, and a counsel meeting hut. The homes of Florians are within the forest, on the outskirts of these infrastructures. Their infrastructure is made of mainly wood provided by the Arborians, but is infused with strands of nature magic to create strong, withstanding structures. The bright blue and pink strands that course through the wood makes it apparent that the buildings Florians made contain some form of artificial technology to enhance the bonding within the wood. Florians live under an oligarchical government, and are known for their political and tactical leadership that views natural beauty as synonymous with power. Florians thus hold looks and status to a high regard. Their values stem from their flowery origins as they use the size, shape, color, and their ancestry to influence social hierarchy and power placements. There are power struggles as Florian nobles use the amount and color of specific flower petals around their necks to indicate status symbols, and balls are held among the nobility to show off their beautiful clothes and elegant dances. However, Florians are not as vapid as one may paint them to be; the development of their AI, located in the core of the Lily House, holds infinite inspiration for designers and dreamers alike, giving the Florians the ability to start the newest fashion trend, write the most inspiring tunes, and design beautiful architecture .The Florians’ political sector within the Lily House ensures that the AI functions are constantly in check so they can regularly uphold the rest of society.

Working-class Florians produce world-class beauty products such as perfume, makeup, and clothing to sell and trade. They thus have less petals around their necks, as they use them to provide wares for their shops. Because their goods are made of natural materials, their organic waste products are sold to the Mycelians, who break them down and absorb the nutrients. The Florians have a great distaste for Frontier and the Dystopia, as the drab and dreary state of the people are such an eyesore.

## Arborians

The Arborians live near the South East border, or what can be defined as the boundary between the Ecotopia and the Dystopia. In this area are the tallest and widest trees in the land. Arborians have built their homes in the bases of these trees, carving into the wood and sculpting the interior to fit their subtle lifestyles. Their homes are completely made out of wood, bark, and sap, and have leaves and berries growing from within them. The wood at the base of their houses has been made elastic to open and close the entryway of their home. They also use this as a form of camouflage on top of the force field made of interwoven branches of the trees’ canopies they have around the community's encampment. Artificial intelligence systems were placed in the center of the Arborian community, projecting into the roots of the tree homes to give the wood elastic-like features and to bend the treetops to form the canopy, evident from the emerald green lines that run through the wood. Arborians hold a high regard to seniority and live as a tribe that follows one elder tree. No one can defy this old, great tree, as it would be against their culture. They are very work-centered, physically adept, and focused on passing on knowledge and culture to the younger generation. To embellish their ingrained values, they have built labs, small factories, a military training base, and a small amphitheater for tribal storytelling. Classes are also taught by elders to younger generations in their homes. The infrastructure is made from enhanced wood, wrapped with strong vines, and painted with sticky sap to create durable structures. Within each building is a probe that acts like a security system inside and within the radius of each building, this probe takes the shape of the rings within the wood so that it is undiscoverable by outsiders. The Arborians’ main purpose is to protect their own and especially their leader, by ensuring that younger generations have the knowledge, resources, and skills to ensure the longevity and safety of their species.

The Arborians produce a great amount of Sylvangrove’s reinforced wood in a sustainable way, making them great contributors to the Florians and their architectural ambitions. The Arborians also produce capsules of highly pure, concentrated oxygen, providing enhanced clarity and strength for those who take it; the more pure the oxygen is, the longer the effects last. These capsules also give the ability for people to breathe underwater for a certain amount of time, thus they are coveted items for oversea traders and explorers looking to visit Karkorte or Aqualumea.

## The Outsiders

There is a separate group of Outer-Florians that reject the idea of using AI to enhance their lifestyles. They live in the far west corner of Ecotopia. Their values remain the same as other Florians who live in the middle of the region—keen on looks and status and very political with great leadership qualities—with the exception that they envision a time when AI did not exist. They view AI as unnatural. They use wood, clay, and stone as well for their small hut homes, but these homes need constant upkeep compared to the other Florian populations, due to a lack of magic amplification by AI. This group is rather small, but they have classrooms, a counsel room, and a high-scale library made from rocks, held together by clay, vines, and flower petals that have been cemented into the cracks of the infrastructure. The area in which they live is less occupied with trees and they instead live closer to the high valleys. These Outer-Florians have naturally grown flower fields and farmland with rows of fruits and vegetables that are difficult to maintain and demand extreme labor, however are deemed the most delicious by all of Sylvangrove.

Despite being the only tribe without the use of AI, the Outer-Florians are respected by other groups in the region . Though they were at first hesitant to associate with these groups in fear of being corrupted by the AI, the other groups were always respectful about their decisions and supported them, so long as they did not turn to Frontier. Outer-Florians are very proud of the lifestyles they have held without technology, and they believe it to be better for the environment and for their mental wellbeing.

Overall, Sylvagrove thrives on generating systems and technology infusions that have been enhancing the environment for generations. Each environment is different in their infrastructure, quality of life, and purposes, but share the commonality of their symbiosis and their goal to preserve the balance between nature and technology in their unique way. Their intra- and interconnectedness with one another ensures they each have one another’s backs. With the looming threat of Frontier, who seek to penetrate into their AI systems and control their minds to expand itself, Sylvangrove hangs on a precarious edge that will test Ecotopia’s sense of unity, technology, and preservation of nature.
