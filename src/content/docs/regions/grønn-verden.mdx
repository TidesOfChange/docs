Grønn Verden didn’t always look the way it does today. When Farmers and Seed Keepers fled their home after the rising floods ripped through their lands, Grønn Verden became a paradise they were happy to call home, with soil steeped with nutrients and moisture ready for plowing. The migrant Seed Keepers built the Seed Vault, which provided the farmers with the necessary seeds to create a biodiversity hub and cultivate their newly found healing magic that arose after the Crystal Calamity. The healing magic was so strong that the farmers were able to heal heavily damaged plants or even extreme burn wounds on the body. With this magic, the land became lush with trees, shrubbery, flowers, and most importantly, endless produce for the people to live off of.

## Frontier Control

Frontier found its way to Grønn Verden, drawn by the prospects of food production, and began to dig its claws. Seeds were no longer allowed to be taken from the Seed Vault to be planted on Grønn Verden lands. The Seed Keepers had to keep the seed library under strict lockdown, not even allowing the Farmers to access the seeds. Although this did not stop the Farmers from cultivating their already planted crops on the outside, and they used their plants to harvest more seeds. Frontier threatened to fire all the Seed Keepers unless they dug up the Farmers’ crops and destroyed their roots and seeds, leaving all but the potatoes and wild berries. The Farmers were no longer able to grow all of the crops they were used to.

Frontier’s goal was to monopolize all of the crops over all humans no matter the social class, and Grønn Verden was the perfect place to do so. Since there were people in other locations on the map that didn't know how to take care of the plants like the Farmers did, Frontier discovered that they could make a lot of profit from selling these crops to other locations on the map. However, they did not trust humans, least of all Farmers from Grønn Verden, to keep their mouths shut and farm for them. Instead, with the help of OmegaAI from Sylvangrove, they developed robot farmers. The Seed Keepers tried to protest when they saw their friends, family, and neighbors massacred and replaced by robots. However, it wasn’t long before they too were replaced by robot seed keepers. Healing magic dwindled to basic healing—small nips and tears on leaves or small cuts and wounds on the body—techniques lost with the diversity of Grønn Verden. All that remained were barren fields, exhausted soil, and a splintered, yet hopeful society.

The surviving Farmers and Seed Keepers fled to a corner of Grønn Verden to establish a new village and made it their mission to write down all of their knowledge. They feared that without the wide expanse of vegetation, they would lose their history. The Seed Keepers used their vast knowledge to write books documenting their life's work, from pre-Crystal Calamity origins to successful farming practices to magical discoveries—even the most mundane detail was written down. They spent years documenting the healing properties of certain plants, the dangers of Frontier, and agricultural practices. Eventually, the people began telling stories so their abilities and history could live on through their children and grandchildren. They spoke of past healing rituals that were performed to bring life back into living things. They spoke of the dangers of greed and taught their children and their grandchildren the importance of biodiversity. In addition to their story telling, they practice healing ceremonies on their potato and berry crops to ensure a bountiful harvest so the magic could still live through the generations. The Seed Keepers and Farmers worked together to modify the crops so that they could get all the nutrients to have the balanced diets they used to have with the diversity found with foods from the Seed Vault just from potatoes and berries.

The Farmers had difficulty finding work once they were cut out by Frontier. They decided to use their strength to their advantage and formed a community coalition to keep the villagers of Grønn Verden safe. There isn’t much crime in Grønn Verden, so they do a little bit of everything to help out and make the lives of their community easier, in addition to patrolling. This includes building new homes, repairing anything broken, and keeping their farming roles to ensure there are enough potatoes and berries to feed everyone. The Seed Keepers also used their limited healing abilities to serve as doctors or nurses, whether for actual patients or plants. But most importantly, they protect the people of Grønn Verden from potential threats made by Frontier.

Outsiders rarely come to Grønn Verden anymore. Most people had been forced here through the wildfires, and now there was even more reason not to come due to the lack of bountiful food and variety. Without access to other crops from the Seed Vault, the villagers are barely able to support themselves. When outsiders do come, they tend to not stay long after seeing the legends they heard about Grønn Verden no longer being true. Some outsiders stay, but they are the ones that choose to help fight with the Farmers and Seed Keepers against the corporation that wronged them. At first this help was unwanted and untrusted, but many of the older villagers saw it as a way to expand and diversify their village, retelling stories of the old days and teaching newcomers the ways of the Farmers, Seed Keepers, and healing magic. Outsiders are able to learn, but always stay separate from the rest of the village since many villagers, especially the poor, do not want to fight for food with a larger population.

## Life in Grønn Verden

Life within the Seed Vault is very different from what it used to be. A giant glass greenhouse was constructed by Frontier to encapsulate the Seed Vault, worker robots, and acres upon acres of farmland. Several sectors of the greenhouse are made of concrete, presumably holding office space and robot control panels. No one is allowed within the vault anymore. The seeds within the Seed Vault were initially selected based on special properties that they have on restoring biodiversity. For example, some of the species are legumes which are known for their ability to fix nitrogen into the soil, a necessary step for other plants to grow well. Another example is different types of trees, which raise water from aquifers and lower the temperature of the soil, allowing other plants to grow well in a cooler temperature.

Frontier used to have office workers in the greenhouse to watch over the robots, but even they too were forced to leave the vault and work remotely in a separate part of the greenhouse, monitoring the robots via surveillance cameras and control panels. To enter the greenhouse, the only access is a truck-sized garage door on the front of the building. This garage door was previously used as access for trucks to unload seeds for the vault and is now used to transport food out of the vault.

Seed keeper robots work inside the now fortified Seed Vault, stocking the library with new seeds after every harvest, and have been programmed to attack any and all things or beings that don’t belong in the greenhouse, with the sole purpose of guarding the vault. The farmer robots are only aggressive if they recognize that a crop has been touched by anything else other than the robot in charge of the crop. Each farmer robot has a specific job within the greenhouse and loading dock in order to keep the produce healthy and to ship out safely, whether it be watering crops, harvesting, or packaging. The produce is sold to interested buyers, whether it be merchants or the wealthy from other lands, or the villagers themselves, although very rarely. Most of the trade that happens in this area is often done among the rich Frontier leaving the poor with the very few crops that they are able to survive on. With this produce being the only source of food outside of the potatoes and berries allowed to be grown outside the vault, Frontier sells the lowest quality produce to the villagers, capitalizing on their demand. To export the produce to other buyers, Frontier utilizes self-driving and self-routing trucks for deliveries in Grønn Verden or to a port for shipment.

With the sheer amount of produce and vegetation Frontier is producing comes the exorbitant use of chemicals to keep them fresh and thriving; washes of fertilizers, pesticides, fungicides, herbicides, anything that ensures no bruising or pests will get to them in the greenhouse and during shipment. Combined with regular irrigation, the urban runoff has steadily permeated through the lands of Grønn Verden, seeping into the cracked lands, and into the few salvageable streams and rivers remaining in the area. Villagers have noticed the growing algal blooms that have started to sprout among the oily film that sits on top of the water’s surface, and the absence of life underneath. This has only added to the challenges the villagers face, which is a scarcity of food, and soon to be a lack of farmable and drinkable water.

## Technology

Anything high tech within Grønn Verden is hidden within the enclosed parts of the greenhouse. Frontier made sure nothing high tech was ever able to reach the villages. Within the greenhouse, everything is as high tech as they could make it. This includes the computers in the office spaces, the equipment in the lab, the farming tools for the greenhouse, and the storage system for the seed library. Much of this technology could have helped the farmers and seed keepers in the village continue their research and log their understanding of their crafts, so Frontier kept this access very limited and constantly monitored at all times. Technology is so limited that all the villagers have reverted to keeping physical notes and using word of mouth to continue keeping tradition alive. Any scraps of technology that the villagers find is repurposed into anything needed within the villages at the time of finding it, such as silos or farming equipment.

In the villages, buildings are cobbled together from whatever material people can scavenge. Buildings are constructed with concrete slabs, rusted thin sheets of metal, and pieces of wood—anything that could be found in the garbage dumped by Frontier from the Seed Vault. These defunct structures form the cities and towns on the outskirts of Grønn Verden, serving as homes for the displaced people. These homes are constructed with only the barest necessities in the pursuit of comfort but also frugality.

People get by on older, cobbled-together technology: scrounging old solar panels for electricity, building simple radios for communication, and using hand tools or simple magic for farming. All technology is treasured, reutilized, and repaired until it is no longer in a working state.

## Travel

Getting around is not easy in Grønn Verden due to most of it being barren land with a few occasional water sources like ponds or rivers. The only roads in the region are for Frontier’s automated trucks that take them to the coastal port or to a designated pitstop, should the villagers ever scrounge up enough money to buy produce. So, it is the old-fashioned ways that people rely upon to make their way across the landscape: bicycles, sturdy carts pulled by animals, at times, using little else than one's feet. These modes are slower but more resilient and meant for traveling on rough terrain over long distances. To get across small pockets of habitable lands, villagers might use sleds or wagons that can drag across the barren soil; they might just walk across cracked earth if the distance is less or take old pathways worn by footsteps over time. Rivers are surprisingly scarce, but where there are some, small rafts of wood or dinghies are utilized, pushed along by poles or manually.

Despite these troubles, the Farmers and Seed Keepers of Grønn Verden do not intend to leave. They feel like they “owe” it to the earth as they have been able to survive on it even after the damage that has been inflicted so far. They feel their new mission is to help fight back against the evil corporation and replant the seeds they once nurtured. The lack of resources also means that it is exponentially harder for the villagers to relocate. Due to this shortage of reliable resources, relocating takes months of hard work and planning. The Farmers that do decide to leave usually have little to no family left and have to take months of saved shelf-stable foods with them. They believe that it is up to them to go and try to find better conditions to live in and cultivate the lands for future use. They have no access to the seeds now but believe there is hope that one day the Seed Vault will be open again and they can take back everything they lost.
