    <TabItem label="General Utility">
    | Spell         | Description |
    |---------------|-------------|
    | Firefly       | Create a small mote of fire that floats just above the palm of your hand. The mote can be used to light a small dark area, start a fire with kindling, or burn a target with a successful unarmed attack, dealing 1 harm + burn (1 harm every 2-3 turns). The Firefly is extinguished after ten minutes or until it meets a target. |
    | Light         | Create a 20 foot radius or a 100 x 5ft beam of light that originates from you and lasts up to one hour.
    | Locate        | You procure a thin wire of silver light that leads you to a location that you know of, or can deduce. If you have never been to a location you are told of, you will have a 50/50 chance of making it where you want to go.
    | Purify        | Removes all toxic elements from a small area of land, air, or water. Area purified amounts to twice your rank in Affinity cubed.
    | Shortâ€‘circuit | Electricity sparks from your hands and the next electrical thing you touch becomes disabled. Simple electrical devices are permanently disabled until they are repaired. Robots, cyborgs, and AI are only temporarily disabled for a number of minutes equal to your rank in Affinity.
    | Repair        | You can use the crystal energy to restore the structure of a destroyed object. More complicated structures require a higher success threshold. Additionally, you can repair any mechanism you made yourself or learned the instruction to. Trying to fix a mechanism you have never encountered can lead to unwanted side effects.

    <TabItem label="Social Utility">
    | Spell     | Description |
    |-----------|-------------|
    | Charm     | You exude an aura of friendliness and trustfulness towards a single target. The target may roll an Awareness check to resist the effects. If the spell is successful, it grants you a +2 to Leadership, Charm, and Bartering. Effects last for one whole interaction and only apply to actions between the caster and the target.
    | Petrify   | Freezes the target with fear and makes them lose their composure. The target may roll an Awareness check to resist the effects. If the spell is successful, it grants you a +2 to Intimidation checks and afflicts the target with -1 to their Strength and Agility checks. Effects last for one whole interaction.
    | Telepathy | Create a message you can send to a willing creature. Unwilling creatures may roll Awareness or Affinity to resist the message.

    <TabItem label="Defensive Utility">
    | Spell                    | Description |
    |--------------------------|-------------|
    | Alarm                    | Create a spell that can wake you up or warn you of danger in the vicinity. It presents itself as a loud ringing in the head. Higher levels increase the area of alarm by 100 feet per level. 
    | Share&nbsp;the&nbsp;Pain | Designates one character you can see (ally or enemy) to be Linked for one minute. While Linked, the caster splits any damage above 1 harm received 50/50 with the other Linked character (i.e. if caster would take 4 harm - instead, the caster takes 2 and the Linked character also takes 2). Odd amounts of harm round down to even. The Link is broken if the caster cannot see the Linked target or the Linked target falls unconscious. May not cast other spells while active.
    | Air&nbsp;Bubble          | Create a number of air bubbles equal to Affinity around yourself and/or others. Air breathing species are able to breathe normally, with no penalties, while underwater with an air bubble. Lasts up to 8 hours. Alternatively, the bubble may also be cast on a non-air breathing species as an attack. Target must have hands free and succeed with a Force roll of 15 to pop the bubble. Otherwise it causes suffocation (1 harm that bypasses soak every 2-3 turns).
    | Water&nbsp;Bubble        | Create a number of water bubbles equal to Affinity around yourself and/or others. Water breathing species are able to breathe normally, with no penalties, while on land with a water bubble. Lasts up to 8 hours. Alternatively, the bubble may also be cast on a non-water breathing species as an attack. Target must have hands free and succeed with a Force roll of 15 to pop the bubble. Otherwise causes suffocation (1 harm that bypasses soak every 2-3 turns).

    | Waterglide           | Create a current or a hydroplaning effect between yourself and the water surface. It allows you to travel 2x as fast on the water or underwater. Lasts one hour.
    | Glide                | You can cancel fall damage by generating an air pillow that slows your fall gradually.
    | Fly                  | Generate air currents to allow yourself the power of flight. You can travel 2x as fast in the air. Lasts ten minutes.
