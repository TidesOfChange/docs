Deep beneath the Earth’s surface lay vast networks of ancient crystals - naturally occurring formations that together maintained both the world’s magnetic and gravitational fields in perfect equilibrium. These crystals formed a complex web of energy nodes across the planet, each cluster resonating in harmony with Earth's core to stabilize the planet’s magnetic field while also sustaining a delicate gravitational balance with the moon and other celestial bodies. Each major crystal cluster developed unique properties based on its surrounding environment, absorbing and reflecting the natural energies of their locations. For millennia, these crystal networks remained hidden from humanity, silently upholding the planet’s delicate environmental balance from deep within the Earth. Their existence was unknown to all but a few, and their true power remained untapped.

Frontier’s discovery of these crystal networks marked a turning point in human history. In their relentless pursuit of new energy sources to power the continually expanding business enterprise, their  deep-earth scanning technology detected these powerful formations. Initial analysis revealed their incredible energy potential which Frontier immediately began developing methods to extract and harness their power. Viewing the crystals purely as an energy resource, Frontier developed aggressive extraction methods using experimental technology. They established extraction sites at major crystal clusters around the world, believing they could accelerate energy production through artificial means. This industrial-scale crystal exploitation gave birth to what would become known as “magi-tech” – the corporate attempt to harness crystal energy without understanding its role in planetary stability.

The forced extraction process had catastrophic consequences. Frontier’s methods not only created highly radioactive by-products through the crystal refinement process, but also disrupted the crystal’s ancient resonance patterns. As crystal clusters were damaged or destroyed, the entire network began to fail. This disruption had a devastating double effect: it weakened Earth’s magnetic field and simultaneously destabilized the planet’s gravitational relationship with celestial objects, especially our closest neighbor – the moon. As the moon’s gravitational influence intensified, it began pulling more strongly on Earth’s oceans. Tidal forces increased dramatically, and ocean currents that had remained stable for millennia began to shift. The gravitational disruption, combined with the weakened magnetic field, led to unprecedented changes in ocean temperatures and circulation patterns. Polar ice, subjected to both intensified gravitational forces and warming waters, began melting at an alarming rate. This cascade of effects triggered what became known as the Great Floods – a catastrophic rise in sea levels that would reshape the face of the planet.

While Frontier’s facilities were shielded from the radiation their crystal extraction released, it rapidly spread across the globe. However, something unexpected occurred. The areas around the remaining crystal clusters – their extraction facilities and the surrounding regions – were affected differently by the radiation. The crystals’ energy, rather than allowing the radiation to be purely destructive, guided the mutations of nearby populations in ways that allowed them to survive in their rapidly changing environments. Each major crystal cluster influenced mutations differently based on its unique properties and local environment. In what would become known as Lumea, exposure to those crystals led to aquatic adaptations. In Sylvangrove, the local crystal cluster fostered plant-like characteristics. Karkorte’s crystals, combined with nuclear radiation, created unique sensory mutations. The Aeolian Archipelago’s crystal cluster attuned its people to weather manipulation.

These crystal sites became safe havens of sorts, where the radiation’s effects were transformed from deadly to adaptive. As the flood water rose and environments changed, these locations would eventually become the centers of new civilizations. Each emergent species gradually discovered they could tap into their region’s crystal energy, developing distinct magical abilities and traditions based on their local crystal cluster’s properties. Today, while Frontier continues to harvest crystal energy through industrial means, the various mutated species have developed their own harmonious relationships with their regional crystals. Some clusters remain undiscovered, their potential unknown. Others lie dormant, waiting to be reawakened. The world exists in a precarious balance between those who have learned to resonate with the crystals’ power and Frontier’s ongoing industrial exploitation.

Some believe that if enough crystal clusters could be restored and their powers harmonized once again, Earth’s magnetic and gravitational stability might return. However, such a task would require unprecedented cooperation between the divided peoples of this new world – and time grows short as Frontier’s influence continues to expand.
