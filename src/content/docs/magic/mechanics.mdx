## Core Mechanics
All magic in this world relies on the power of crystals that emerged after the Calamity. While any creature can learn to draw on the energy of crystals to power rudimentary effects, there are two primary paths for harnessing this power in more masterful ways: Spiritual Resonators (who attune to the crystals through meditation) and Magi-tech Artificers (who use technology to interface with crystal-based energy).

> ##### For non-magic backgrounds
- Characters can innately learn and cast a number of spells equal to their rank in Affinity. 
- Non-magic characters only have access to Utility spells. 
- Spells must be learned and mastered through practice and concentration, and thus characters cannot change the spells they know once they’ve gained them. 
- Once they’ve learned a utility spell, they always know that spell (though they may become unable to draw on the energy that powers it due to various effects). 
- Only one spell may be cast by a non-magic character at a time – spells cannot be stacked. The amount of focus and concentration, however, is mentally exhausting, so each known spell can be cast no more than twice per day before the character will need to rest. 
- After a full period of sleep, all spells are regained.

## Casting Spells

> ##### When targeting a specific creature(s)

On their turn, players roll a d20 + primary attribute + skill modifier.
    - For area and utility spells, use Intuition + Affinity.
    - For spells that require hitting a specific target, use either Force or Shooting as relevant, but may replace the normal attribute with Intuition.
    - For healing spells, use Medicine, but may replace the normal attribute with Intuition.
    - On a critical failure (1), the resource is used but the spell fails and other consequences may result depending on the context.
    - On a critical success (20), the spell ignores armor/harm soaking and may have additional special effects based on spell or expertise tree.

Targets roll a relevant defense (usually Reaction, but in some contexts may also use Force, Awareness, or Affinity).
    - Depending on context, targets might incur a penalty or disadvantage to this roll. For instance, a target right in the middle of a 30-foot tornado is going to have a really difficult time evading that threat. GM should use their judgement. 

If a player's total for the spell exceeds the opponent(s)’s defense, the spell/tech hits and all conditions go into effect.

If the opponent(s)’s total is higher, they successfully evade the spell’s impacts.
    - Depending on the level of the player’s and/or opponents’ success, the player and GM may decide certain effects do or don’t happen, as well as how long those effects last (if multiple turns).

When a harm-causing spell hits, it deals a certain level of harm, reduced potentially by the target's armor/soaking (unless critical success).

Players can focus (skip a turn) to gain advantage on the next roll.

> ##### When targeting self, a willing ally, or a non-damaging area effect

On their turn, players roll d20 + primary attribute + skill modifier (usually Affinity)

GM may decide the success threshold based on the complexity of the spell or intended action, but the following remains true:
    - 1: Critical failure
        - Resource used but spell fails, other consequences may result depending on the context.
    - 20: Critical success
        - Spells automatically succeed with some other unexpected positive result, within reason.

<br />

> ##### Defensive Spells

Defensive spells, that protect against danger or other effects, may be cast out of turn in reaction to a trigger. Casting a defensive spell out of turn, however, uses the action of your next turn.

## Using Magi-tech as a non-Artificer
Players and NPCs may come across – by legitimate or non-legitimate means – pieces of Frontier Magi-tech. Users who are not adept in using this technology (i.e. not a trained Magi-tech Artificer) have trouble controlling the effects. In order to effectively power a Magi-tech effect, non-Artificers must first make a successful Cybernetics check (the GM can determine the threshold based on the level of gear and its current condition). A mixed-success may result in a spell activating at random rather than the desired one (roll a d6 to determine). A critical fail results in damaging the equipment so that it is unusable. Since the spell is powered by the equipment, Affinity checks are not required for spell success, but targets may still roll relevant defense checks.

Non-Artificers also do not have access to the Biomass Harvesting feature of the equipment. Spent charges may only be regained through new batteries or the organic transfer function (perform any spell at the expense of 1 deep wound (gives 1 harm, but requires 2 healing)). In order to use the organic transfer function correctly, the user must also succeed on a Medicine check in addition to the Cybernetics check. A fail could result in increased damage and/or the spell not taking effect, at the GMs discretion. 

:::caution[note]
**There are two magic backgrounds that may be taken to gain access to more powerful magical effects.**
These are the Spiritual Resonator and Magi-tech Artificer. See those backgrounds for more detailed information including full spell list, but the following is a quick-look guide on playing a magic-focused character. 
:::

> ##### Spiritual Resonator Magic

Resources
- Magic Points (MP): Base 5 + (Affinity rank × 2)
- Each spell costs MP equal to its level
- MP can be restored through meditation, adequate rest, or potions (once per day)

Primary Stats
- Intuition: Main stat

Key Skills
- Affinity: Intuition-based modifier to learn and power spells

Combat Actions
- Cast one spell per turn
- Focus (skip turn) for advantage on next spell

Learning Spells
- Start with 2 spells of choice
- Spell capacity equals the starting 2 + rank in Affinity, for a max of 7 spells
    - The Expertise Tree offers additional spells that do not count towards this total
- Must find a trainer and barter/pay a fee to learn new non-utility spells
- Learning new utility spells does not require a trainer, just concentration and practice

<br />

> ##### Magi-tech Artificer Magic

Resources
- Battery Charges (BC): Each gear piece holds 3 BC
- Each function costs 1 BC
- BC can be restored through biomass harvesting, organic transfer, or purchasing from Frontier

Primary Stats
- Knowledge: Main stat 

Key Skills
- Cybernetics: Knowledge-based modifier for tech operations
- Mechanics: Intuition-based modifier for building/fixing
- Environmentalism (unique skill): Ability to efficiently harvest biomass

Combat Actions
- Activate one tech function per turn
- Defensive reactions
- Utility functions as needed

Gear Acquisition
- Start with utility gear 
- Purchase additional gear from Frontier, or via other means
- Upgrade gear through special missions or quests

## Unified Combat Rules
Both magic types follow similar core mechanics in combat:
1. Initiative: Roll d20 + Agility + Reaction
2. Attack Roll: d20 + primary attribute + relevant skill
3. Defense Roll: d20 + primary attribute + relevant skill
4. Hit Resolution:
    - If attack roll > defense roll: Hit
    - If attack roll ≤ defense roll: Miss
5. Damage: Deal wounds equal to spell power minus target's armor
6. Critical Success (roll 20):
    - Ignore target's armor
    - Trigger special effects
7. Critical Failure (roll 1):
    - Resource spent with no effect
    - Possible negative consequences
8. On a tie:
    - Spell hits but with a complication
    - Target can counter in some way

## Status Effects 
Some spells can inflict various status effects on targets who are susceptible to those effects. These effects last until they are healed appropriately. How often they happen should be determined by the level of success of the spell and/or any weaknesses of the target.
- **Bleeding**: 1 harm every 2-3 turns
- **Burn**: 1 harm every 2-3 turns
- **Acid**: harm increases exponentially in subsequent turns
- **Concussion**: Remove skill modifiers from rolls
- **Paralysis**: Skip 1-2 turns
- **Suffocation**: 1 harm every 2-3 turns, bypasses armor/soak
