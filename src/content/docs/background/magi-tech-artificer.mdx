## Description
Magi-tech 1.0 is the crown jewel of the Frontier R&D Team. The gear utilizes a combination of crystal shards and top-notch nanoprocessing, allowing users to manipulate the molecules and atoms around them, creating weapons, shields, and healing solutions. While anyone can technically use this gear, Artificers (gearheads in the parlance of less sensitive creatures) have undergone training to develop a deeper understanding of the programming and energy that goes into its safe and effective use. All Artificers are required to take a training course and remain registered (requires annual renewal) with Frontier to use proprietary equipment. As a result, they can safely push magi-tech to its limits, and beyond.

## Background Bonuses
- **Skill Bonuses:** 
    - **Force** - strength, hand-to-hand combat and melee, as well as general strength. Used for attack roll modifier
    - **Foraging** - knowledge, how well you can find food, water, and other survival necessities
    - **Cybernetics** - knowledge, ability to interact with computers and programs
    - **Mechanics** - knowledge, ability to build and fix things
    - **Awareness** - intuition, how attuned to surroundings
- **Unique Skill:** Environmentalism (intuition) 
    - The ability to harvest biomass more effectively. Adding a point reduces the amount of biomass pulled by 3 cubic feet. Also allows more efficacy in finding available biomass in barren terrains.
- **Equipment:**
    - Frontier utility boots or backpack (your choice)
    - Pellet gun and bag of pellets
    - Tool kit
- **NPC Connections:** One useful NPC connection (recommended: a magi-tech dealer, trainer, or repairer)

## Frontier Magi-tech Gear 1.0
Magi-tech artificers are adept in using Frontier’s Gem Suite. While novice users may don magi-tech, they often struggle with controlling the effects and have little ability to repair broken or damaged equipment – challenges adept artificers do not experience. Magi-tech gear can be legitimately purchased from the Frontier Corp, with an active registration, in 7 tiers: 

    - 100c each for Utility Boots or Backpack (10 charges)
    - 100c for one glove (3 charges)
    - 200c for second glove (3 charges)
    - 300c for pants (3 charges)
    - 400c for chest (3 charges)
    - 500c for helmet (3 charges)
    - 1000c to unify the system (unifies pieces with 15 total charges that can be used at user’s discretion)
    - 25c for extra batteries

All Magi-tech artificers begin having completed the required training and with an active registration. 

Each piece of equipment contains progressively more powerful tech. Unlike Crystal magic, it uses nanoprocessing to restructure atomic structures of materials, creating desired effects. Each piece contains 3 battery charges (BC) and each function in a piece of gear requires 1 BC to power. Players can replace batteries only once per day. After all BCs are spent, gear is overheated, and the player has to allow it a long rest to cool down before it may be used again. Players CANNOT use battery charges in one piece of gear to power functions in other pieces (can’t use glove charges to power chest spells). The exception to this is in receiving the final piece of gear – **Perfected Transmutation Core series**. It unifies all battery charges into one system, allowing players to pull all 15 charges according to how they want. Requires all pieces of gear (not including Utility series) to implement, and losing any of the pieces breaks the unification.

Renewing charges requires a new biomass battery that can be either purchased from Frontier (25c) or created by using the **biomass harvester** subscription, which injects a machine into ground to suction up to 30 cubic feet of biomass to recharge up to 3 batteries (10cu and one turn per charge). Harvesting biomass leaves the area depleted of life until properly restored. Forests, oceans, meadows and the like are good sources of biomass. If a person is in a desert, mountainous, or otherwise barren terrain, it is to GM’s discretion if they will allow biomass harvesting. **Biomass harvester is a paid subscription**, requiring **100c per month** to keep active.

If batteries or biomass are unavailable, users can choose to power a spell using the organic transfer feature: perform any spell at the expense of **1 deep wound** (gives **1 harm**, but requires **2 healing**).

## Expertise Tree
