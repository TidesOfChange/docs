description: Public Servant Background
---

Civically minded diplomats who jump at the opportunity to lead people. Every era of the Earth has seen these types of people in some form or another, and the current one is no different. As landscapes and ways of life across the planet have transformed rapidly in the current era, it is now more important than ever to have inspiring leaders who know how to connect disparate groups of people and negotiate nuanced decisions. Public servants tend to be people who place a lot of value in empowering the public, promoting free thinking, and fostering community cooperation. As part of their training they learn anything and everything that could benefit a civil society, such as leadership, negotiation, persuasion, and the law. Their focus on understanding people and abstract rules makes public servants extremely sharp when reading situations or using logical thinking. Due to their constant interactions in the public sphere, you can expect any public servant to have a wide net of connections, whether they be allies or opponents.
