> *“The path of harmony requires patience, but offers limitless potential”*
>
> *-Old Lumea Saying*

After the Calamity the World has changed like never before. Everything was out of balance, shattered, and disorganized. The remaining parts of the world bore the new formations – beautiful translucent crystals. Those who had the patience could sit down and hear a high pitched whirring changed out by the low pitch hum, almost like the crystals were lamenting loss of balance, but expressed the hope for the future. Those rare few who spent days and weeks listening to the rocks instead of helping to rebuild whatever was left of the world were ridiculed and hated by their peers. However, after years of meditating, listening, and recognizing the patterns, some were able to attune to the resonance produced by the crystals. Attuning allowed them to tap into the network of crystals, and harness the energy potential stored in them. It began with humble experiments like igniting and putting out candles with the utmost concentration and slowly turned into an ability to hurl rocks weighing hundreds of pounds with as little as a flick of a finger. Spiritual Resonators, as they called themselves, became a small but tightly knit group of individuals. Due to the past hostilities, it is not a path walked by many. While any creature could hypothetically learn to resonate with the crystals, the amount of effort, time, and willpower it takes to truly master these effects made it almost a stuff of legends, told to the little kids who dream about adventures. 

### Skills and Equipment
- **Core Skills:** Affinity, Deduction, Medicine, Awareness, Charm
- **Unique Skill:** Premonition (Short description goes in parenthesis, if long description is required use subheader)
    - The ability to visualize future events. You can ask the DM about an event that will happen in the near future. Higher dice rolls will require DM to give more precise information. Additionally, can be used by players to determine strengths and weaknesses in newly met creatures.
- **Unique Expertise:** Skill Name
- **Equipment:** Defender’s Ring (stores one defensive level-1 spell that can be cast for free once per day), Long Bamboo Staff, Enchanter’s Gloves (adds 1 extra Magic Point when worn).

- **NPC Connections:** A teacher or mentor who taught the Spiritual Resonator magic.

### Magic Points (MP)
Characters start with 5 MP that can be spent on spells. Characters have an additional number of MP equal to their rank in Affinity x2. Each spell costs MP = to its level. 

### Learning Spells
Players start with 2 level-1 spells of choice in their arsenal. Adding levels in Affinity allows you the capacity to learn 1 additional spell per level. In order to learn new spells, or to replace lower level spells with higher level spells, you have to find a trainer and barter/pay a fee. Even if you begin the game with a character who has a rank of 3 in Affinity, you may not access additional spells beyond the starting 2 until you’ve met the aforementioned conditions to learn them. You can only learn and cast spells of a level equal to your rank in Intuition. Utility spells count towards the known spells total, but require no formal training. Some expertises unlocked in the expertise tree allow you to learn additional spells or effects. These do not count towards the limits on spells known.
