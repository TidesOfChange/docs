## Description

The ranger grew up in a close knit village that valued community over anything. The rangerâ€™s father was an explorer and the mother was a warrior. As a small child, the ranger lost their pet family of frogs to seagulls. Devastated by the loss of their beloved pets, the ranger vowed to devote their life to protection of their loved ones and their surroundings. Being raised by an explorer and a warrior, the ranger is able to survey the nearby area and assess any danger. When faced with danger, they can fend for themselves in a pinch but are not as strong as a full on warrior class character. The ranger loves to explore nature in their free time.
