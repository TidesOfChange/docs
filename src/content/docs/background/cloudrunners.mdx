description: Class from Aeolian Archipelago
---

Cloudrunners are criminals. Although some may have noble intentions or lofty goals, the life of a Cloudrunner is characterized by violent conflict, constant danger, and a struggle for survival. Most law-abiding citizens try to keep their head down and avoid Cloudrunners at all costs, lest they become collateral damage in the fighting. Enterprising local businesses may enlist the help of Cloudrunners for a variety of reasons—bodyguards/protection, disrupting corporate actions, smuggling money or goods, or any activities that they might want to keep hidden from Frontier and its subsidiaries. These contracts are the main source of income for most Cloudrunners, highly prized and contested among rival Cloudrunner “cells” (factions). Reputation is everything, and less reliable Cloudrunners tend to be kicked out of groups and are left behind. Contractors rarely dare to deal in bad faith with Cloudrunners because they know that they could just as easily be the Cloudrunners’ next target. Cloudrunners need to be able to adapt and survive in a chaos-fueled environment on a daily basis. They also pose a unique skill to only their culture:  Cloudrunners also have the ability to communicate with cohorts who may not seem so friendly. As with their nature, Cloudrunners have been seen dealing with leaders of regional cells, corporation contacts, and other bosses from their previous work.

## Expertise Tree
|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Tier&nbsp;1** | **Knife's Edge:** You've spent significant time in a constant state of danger and deceit, sharpening your instincts. Add an extra d6 to Intuition rolls.                                                                        | **Expert Negotiator:** Your experience lets you read people very well, even in unfamiliar areas. You always know whether you are being offered a fair deal, and you roll an extra d6 on bartering checks that involve your services.    | **Dangerous Determination:** Your tenacity can get you through the toughest situations. Once per day, when you roll a check and fail, you may choose to reroll it. You must use the new roll, even if it's worse.                    |
| **Tier&nbsp;2** | **Informant Network:** You have connections that run deep in criminal networks. When seeking information, you are able to find someone who can either tell you or find out for you - for the right price, of course.            | **Mask of Many:** Your time as a Cloudrunner has taught you the value of having multiple identities. Your disguises are good enough to pass cursory inspection and you can always obtain realistic fake ID documents for a new persona. | **Unwavering Resolve:** When you are in melee range of more than one enemy, add +1 per enemy to reaction, bypass that many harm from ranged attacks, and you may distribute harm from attacks among multiple enemies of your choice. |
| **Tier&nbsp;3** | **Featherstep:** Your training and experience lets you gracefully adapt to unexpected circumstances. You take no harm from falling 30 ft or less and may turn any effect that would knock you prone into an elegant somersault. | **Reflexive Evasion:** Your instincts alert you to incoming attacks early, giving you extra precious moments to dodge. Once per round you can roll your reaction to dodge an attack.                                                    | **Cloudburst:** You channel the essence of clouds inside your soul, expelling steam in a powerful burst around you as an action. Everyone in melee range is pushed back 10 feet and takes 1 harm, bypassing armor.                   |
