## Description

Enchanters find their way into magic through a mysterious and ephemeral book that seems to manifest around people who are especially attuned to crystal energy. This book is called The Enchanter’s Code. Upon initial opening, however, it appears to be only a container in which a Defender’s Ring is stored. On the inside cover is written: “Put the ring on your left pinky finger and open the book again.” Upon doing so, The Enchanter’s Code transforms into a full book written in a complex and archaic language. With dedicated study, however, Enchanters learn to channel various magical effects through the Defender’s Ring. While not nearly as adept as specially trained Spiritual Resonators, Enchanters are able to use their intuition to tap into the energy of crystals in specific ways.
