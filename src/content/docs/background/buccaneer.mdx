title: Buccaneer
description: Buccaneer Background
---

Buccaneers are sea-faring individuals who hunt, explore, scavenge, and enjoy the thrill of a good fight, bargain, and adventure. They don’t like being tied down to one place, and are often nomadic and highly active like Wandering Wayfarers. Buccaneers are often mercenaries, not concerned with the way things are done, as long as they get done. Though treasure and glory is what motivates them the most, they have strong loyal ties to their travelling companions. Despite the lack of shared blood they would do anything and have each other’s backs, sink or swim. They protect themselves with their gun-slinging prowess, notably using harpoon guns in their naval battles–a useful item for both fishing and fighting. Not only are they great on the water, with an innate agility to survive undercurrents and steer ships across rogue waves, they foraging the land for anything of value, including items that may not be up for grabs. Buccaneers are extremely useful for the economy and local communities, being the only ones brave enough to venture into unseen lands to gather materials and redistribute them. They circulate trade with their expertise in fishing, truly managing to scour any and all resources from both land and sea. This does not mean that they overconsume – they see utility in things that people might throw out in a heartbeat, improvise by turning broken flashlight into an engine part, know how to make one single fish last for days at sea, and share the wealth with impoverished communities. Though, they are known to keep a shiny trophy or two for themselves.
