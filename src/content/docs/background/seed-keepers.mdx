## Description
Seed Keepers are a group of scholars that take care of the seeds in the seed vault. They are responsible for cataloging, studying, and protecting the seeds. They have deep knowledge of plant species. Seed Keepers catalog every seed, maintaining a database that records each species. Seed Keepers also have a strong understanding of the seed vault’s security and technology. They are not only the caretakers of the seed vault but also the guardians of biodiversity.

## Class Bonuses
- **Leadership**: Organize the community and earn trust through persuasive abilities.
- **Force**: Physical strength and hand-to-hand combat skills to protect the seed vault.
- **Bartering**: Skilled in making trades and getting good deals.
- **Insight**: Ability to read people and situations accurately.
- **Sneakiness**: Move undetected to protect valuable seeds and navigate sensitive areas.

### Unique Skill: Peacekeeping
The seed keepers can connect deeply with the natural energy of the world, sensing the health and stability of surrounding plants. The seed keepers can create a temporary protective barrier around seeds or plants, protecting them from environmental hazards or physical threats. The shield preserves the vitality of the seeds. When the seed keepers are in the seed vault, this ability gives them time to transfer the seeds.

### Equipment
- **Data Tablet**: A device that the seed keepers secretly keep that contains information about the seed vault’s species and storage methods.
- **Portable Seed Kit**: Contains a sample of the most rare seed.
- **Old Key**: Used to work for accessing the seed vault and secured areas.

### Connections
- **Driver Connection**: One of the seed keepers knows one of the drivers, because they were childhood friends. The driver occasionally talks about his work life, so the seed keeper knows some information about the structure of the seed vault.
