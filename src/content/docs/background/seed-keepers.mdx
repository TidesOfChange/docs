description: Seed Keepers Background
---

Seed Keepers are a group of scholars that take care of the seeds in the Seed Vault. They are responsible for cataloging, studying, and protecting the seeds. They have deep knowledge of plant species. Seed Keepers catalog every seed, maintaining a database that contains each species. Seed Keepers also have a strong understanding of the Seed Vault’s security and technology. After the Seed Vault was taken over by Frontier and they were fired from their jobs, Seed Keepers were in charge of documenting their life’s work of successful farming practices and healing powers. In the new villages, they also serve as doctors and nurses for both patients and plants. Seed Keepers possess five skills that enable them to serve as protectors of the seeds.
