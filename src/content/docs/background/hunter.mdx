## Description

Hunters are also backbones of Karkote due to the low amounts of food present at a time. There is no infrastructure set up for farming, so Karkorte is mainly supported by hunting and gathering. Hunters are widely prevalent in the community because fishing is the main way that the citizens are getting fed. Hunting is vital for the survival of the community. Also with limited resources, hunters are forced to become crafty with their weaponry making them really versatile.
